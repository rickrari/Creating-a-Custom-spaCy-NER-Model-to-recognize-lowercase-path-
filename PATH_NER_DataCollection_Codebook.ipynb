        "\n",
        "The Port Authority Trans Hudson (PATH) is a subway system connecting Manhattan to Hudson and Essex Counties in New Jersey. The Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (H&M), a private company, built and began operating the system in 1908. Like most privately owned passenger rail systems in the US, competition from private automobiles and rising infrastructure costs pushed H&M into bankruptcy in the 1950s. The governors of New York and New Jersey prevented the railroad from falling apart by having the Port Authority (PA) take it over in 1962 as part of a deal that let the PA build the World Trade Center ([Citizens Budget Committee - CBC, 2014](https://cbcny.org/sites/default/files/REPORT_PATH_04242014.pdf)).\n",
        "\n",
        "The PA is an independent authority responsible for multiple forms infrastructure including; the region’s airports, several bridges and, and most of the region’s ports. The PA does not receive tax revenue and instead funds its infrastructure from user fees. The PA uses surplus user fees from net revenue positive infrastructure, like the airports or the tunnels and bridges, to pay for net revenue negative infrastructure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Like almost all subway systems, PATH requires more money to run than it can take in from fares or other sources. However, unlike any other subways or metros in the US, PATH does not receive local tax support, instead PATH is funded entirely by the PA. PATH costs loses about $400 million a year, limiting the PA’s ability to invest in other forms of infrastructure. (NYT, 2019). Discussion over how to solve PATH’s funding problems have gone on for decades, with many organizations suggesting that PATH benefit from local taxes ([CBC, 2014](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/nyregion/path-train-nj-nyc.html)). In 2014 the PA itself suggested PATH should receive some local tax funding ([Port Authority, 2014](https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/SpecialPanelReporttotheGovernors2014-12-26FINAL.pdf)). If PATH is ever to receive local tax support, PA leaders need to better understand how the public and regional leaders view the agency.\n",
        "\n",
        "PATH serves a region with multiple newspapers that report on development and local policies. Analyzing text from these newspapers can help PATH better understand how leaders in the region view the agency, identify potential allies, and look for communities with which it needs to improve relations.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, most textual analysis in python requires lemmatizing (the process of breaking words down to their root) and standardizing all text as lowercase ([Krisel, Topic Modeling, 2024](https://github.com/rskrisel/topic_modeling_workshop/blob/main/topic_modeling_tomotopy_workshop.ipynb)). This presents a problem for analyzing data related to PATH, because while python can recognize PATH as an organization when it is written in capital letters, it cannot recognize ‘path’ (written in lowercase letters). This paper will demonstrate this issue and show how to solve it by training a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model using spaCy, an open-source software library for advanced natural language processing.\n"

        "\n",
        "This paper collected data from Factiva, a Dow Jones owned tool which aggregates data from thousands of media publications. The author had access to Factiva through his affiliation with Columbia University.\n",
        "\n",
        "To find articles that mention PATH specifically, the author searched “Port Authority Trans Hudson” and limited results to articles from the New York Times and The Bergen Record – two leading newspapers that focus on the New York-New Jersey region that PATH serves. This search returned 273 results from January 1980 through December 2024. Searching for just “PATH” from these sources returns 112,191 results, most of which have nothing to do with the PATH subway, providing further evidence for a custom tool which can distinguish between PATH and the common word path.\n",
        "\n",
        "The author collected the first 100 articles from the search results by setting the display option to “Full Article/Report plus indexing” and the duplicates option to “identical”. Then from the print view window the author clicked control+u to view and copy the html code for all 100 articles (following the technique outlined in [Krisel, Factiva 2024](https://github.com/rskrisel/factiva_dataframe/blob/main/Create_spreadsheet_Factiva_data.ipynb)). The rest of the coding in this Colab codebook is also adapted from the Krisel Factiva resource unless otherwise noted."

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >PATH has been the target of plenty of criticism in its long history. It was the original railroad between New Jersey and Manhattan, its first tube under the Hudson having opened in 1907. That was a few years before the tunnel that connects <span class=\"companylink\">Amtrak</span> and <span class=\"companylink\">New Jersey Transit</span> trains to Penn Station.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Back then, the railroad was known as the Hudson & Manhattan and its Hudson Terminal stood where the World Trade Center was later built. After the H.&M. went bankrupt, it was acquired by the <span class=\"companylink\">Port Authority</span> and renamed the <span class=\"companylink\">Port Authority</span> Trans-Hudson in the early 1960s.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Since then, as PATH's popularity has rebounded, the agency has spent billions of dollars operating and expanding the system. Still, it may be the least appreciated, most unprofitable subway system in the country.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Even before the intensive repairs at Penn Station began, PATH had the seventh-highest ridership of any heavy-rail system in the country. It carried an average of 266,600 weekday passengers in the first three months of this year, a 2.1 percent increase over the first quarter of 2016, according to data compiled by the <span class=\"companylink\">American Public Transportation Association</span>.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >When the <span class=\"companylink\">Port Authority</span> convened a special panel on its future three years ago, the group called PATH a vital alternative to crossing the Hudson in cars and buses. But the panel recommended finding a way to reduce the financial drag on the agency, possibly by bringing in a partner to help run it.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The panel concluded that the PATH system was far more expensive to operate, relative to its size, than the New York subway or any of the metropolitan area's commuter railroads. They also noted that PATH was much smaller than other heavy-rail systems like the subways in Washington and Chicago and had some characteristics similar to those of commuter railroads like the <span class=\"companylink\">Long Island Rail Road</span> and <span class=\"companylink\">New Jersey Transit</span>.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >PATH ranked between the <span class=\"companylink\">Long Island Rail Road</span> and the <span class=\"companylink\">Metro-North Railroad</span> in annual passenger trips, but the typical trip on PATH was far shorter. Each of those two commuter railroads carried its passengers for more than two billion total miles annually, compared with 370 million miles for PATH.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >And unlike those railroads, PATH charges a flat fare for all trips. That fare, now $2.75, has risen to be comparable to the single-ride New York City subway fare. But it does not come close to covering operating costs, which last year amounted to a loss of $415 million. Officials said they hoped the compensation from <span class=\"companylink\">New Jersey Transit</span> would offset their added costs this summer.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The panel found that fares covered less than 45 percent of Path's operating costs in 2013, compared with about 60 percent for <span class=\"companylink\">New Jersey Transit</span> and Metro-North and 73 percent for the New York City subway. That ratio left PATH losing an average of $348 million a year for the previous five years, the panel found.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >It remains the least expensive way of crossing the Hudson, cheaper than a bus from Hoboken, less than half the cost of a ferry and far less costly than the $15 cash toll at the Lincoln and Holland tunnels and the George Washington Bridge. Indeed, the <span class=\"companylink\">Port Authority</span> uses the tolls it collects at the bridge and the Holland and Lincoln tunnels to offset its steep losses on PATH.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But, despite those losses and the panel's recommendation to reduce the financial burden on the <span class=\"companylink\">Port Authority</span>, the <span class=\"companylink\">Port Authority</span> plans to spend heavily to expand the PATH system. It intends to extend PATH from downtown Newark to Newark Liberty International Airport at a projected cost of $1.7 billion. The Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a commuter advocacy group, has criticized the plan, arguing that the agency should invest in improving existing stations to accommodate growing ridership.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >For now, several thousand commuters are just glad that PATH exists. Rosaria Di Grande, who lives in Summit, N.J., and normally rides a <span class=\"companylink\">New Jersey Transit</span> train directly to and from Penn Station on the Morris and Essex line, is one of those.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''The PATH is always crowded, but it's been very efficient as the trains are quite frequent and there's never too long of a wait,'' said Ms. Di Grande, an executive assistant at Montblanc in Olympic Tower. ''I do find the PATH trains to be very clean and new.''</p>\n",

He was an exceptional person intellectually and a kind, compassionate caring human being. He was a WWII Veteran, a volunteer, in the <span class=\"companylink\">US Army</span> from 1942-1946, first an enlistee then a 90-day-wonder commissioned officer, forever proud of his military service. After Technical High School in Newark, NJ, he attended The <span class=\"companylink\">New Jersey Institute of Technology</span> receiving his BS and MS Degrees in Electrical Engineering, then becoming a registered Professional Engineer (PE) in New York and New Jersey.

Much of his electrical engineering design work involved New York City's Holland and Lincoln Tunnels, The George Washington Bridge, The <span class=\"companylink\">Port Authority</span> Bus Terminal, The <span class=\"companylink\">Port Authority</span> Trans Hudson (PATH), The World Trade Center, Kennedy International and LaGuardia Airports, and New Jersey's Newark International Airport, where he played a major role in a 1963 expansive redevelopment, construction and modernization program, and was the consultant for all the lighting and power facilities, receiving high recognition. Through the years he received many <span class=\"companylink\">Port Authority</span> accolades. In 1980, he was awarded the <span class=\"companylink\">Port Authority</span>'s Distinguished Service Medal \"For demonstrating an exceptional degree of good judgment, initiative and competence in his field of endeavor and sustained this record of outstanding or distinguished service over a number of years, at least 15 years of service.\" When retiring, his <span class=\"companylink\">Port Authority</span> plaque was inscribed \"A Distinguishing Award To Daniel L.

He was also an instructor for the IEEE, and held numerous other positions. The immensity of his ongoing contributions to the IEEE culminated in being awarded a special bronze medal inscripted \"The IEEE Awards This Third Millennium Medal to Daniel L. Goldberg in 2000 for Outstanding Achievements and Contributions.\" Daniel was a child of \"The Great Depression of the '30's,\" never forgetting the prevailing poverty, imbuing him with a lasting sense of empathy and philanthropy. For 40 years, he was a member and supporter of The American Technion Society, of The Technion Society of Israel, the leading Engineering and Science Institution, and in 2000 he received their Crystal Triangle, the highest award for being a PATRON. He was also a long time recognized supporter of the National Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC. And he was an Alma Mater supporter of the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark College of Engineering, \"An Alumni Fellow Supporter For Significant Support to Engineering Education,\" these among so many others. Archeology was another of Daniel's interests. For many years he was a member of the Biblical Archeology Society, an international organization, taking him on several Middle East excavations, to dig sites of historical biblical importance, mainly to Israel. He was an inveterate traveler and had visited China, India, Egypt, Greece, Morocco, France, England, Germany, Ecuador, Argentina, Mexico, Alaska, and other places. He enjoyed music, and opera, and possessed a delightful sense of humor, wise and witty. His appreciation and knowledge of art and art history were boundless. He was a member of the <span class=\"companylink\">Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> for the past 40 years, and a long time Friend of <span class=\"companylink\">The New York Public Library</span>. And, in his characteristic modest, unassuming manner, he was a member of the American MENSA, the world-wide society for exceptionally high intelligence quotient individuals. After enduring prolonged suffering, David passed away from Parkinson's Disease, that still incurable illness. He is survived by a son, Alan Goldberg, a professor in California, and also a companion of long years, Irene Field, who he deeply loved, and to whom he was so deeply devoted. Daniel L. Goldberg was truly a special person, dedicated to Engineering, from childhood, and blessed with so many other fine attributes. He was loved and respected by all who knew him, and all whose lives he touched, and he will be greatly missed. With everlasting love. Irene</p>\n",

The railroad came through in 1891, and Essex Fells became a borough in 1902. Train service was discontinued in 1966.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I like to think of it as a little neighborhood secret,'' said Casey Smith, a former subway rider who abandoned the No. 1 train after discovering the Christopher Street PATH station a few blocks from his West Village apartment.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Built as a connection between New Jersey and New York's business districts, PATH makes stops in the West Village, Chelsea and Midtown before terminating a block from Pennsylvania Station. (A separate line runs to the World Trade Center.)</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >To the uninitiated, a ride on the PATH train might seem like stumbling into a Bizarro World subway. The familiar wooden benches of the subway station are replaced by curvy seats made from silver plastic. The ubiquitous security warning -- ''If You See Something, Say Something'' -- is rendered in PATHese: ''You Call It In, We Check It Out.'' The signage has a less graceful version of the subway's Helvetica, and the Corinthian columns are painted an oddly vivid blue.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But regular riders say that PATH trains are more frequent, cleaner and quieter than subway trains. ''Significantly less screeching,'' said Mr. Smith, who, like many converts to PATH, stumbled upon the railroad months after moving into his neighborhood. In two years of daily rides on PATH, he said he had never waited longer than five minutes for a train.</p>\n",

With the price of a monthly MetroCard going up to $104 next year, longtime PATH riders say they expect to see more riders coming through the turnstiles of that railroad, where a 30-day pass costs $54.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A modern, perk-filled transit system has always seemed out of reach for New York's embittered subway riders, who have resigned themselves to a seemingly endless cycle of service cuts, fare increases and bungled attempts at improved technology.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Despite its lower cost, PATH offers high-tech features, like tap-and-go electronic fare cards and onboard television screens that stream news and weather reports -- amenities that the troubled New York City subway is still struggling to install.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''It's faster and more pleasant, and it gives you a discount, which I always like,'' said Tina DiFeliciantonio, a television producer, who takes her 7-year-old son, Luca, on PATH each day from their home in Chelsea to his school in the West Village. She said the school's proximity to the PATH train was a factor in deciding to enroll her son there. ''It's cheaper than taking the 1 train,'' she said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The idea for an underground railroad across the Hudson River dates back to the Gilded Age, but PATH, then known as the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad, did not begin operating until 1907, three years after the city's subway opened. It was renamed the Port Authority Trans-Hudson after its current operator took over in 1962.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Many of PATH's perks stem from its small size, which makes the railroad easier and cheaper to clean and maintain. The system handles about 245,000 trips on an average weekday, fewer than half of the trips taken on the No. 6 subway line alone, and its 14 stations in New York and New Jersey offer only a small fraction of the reach of the sprawling city subway.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >PATH's small size has also made the railroad an attractive target for technology companies seeking a test subject for initiatives, like the computer-chip-enabled fare cards now offered on the railroad.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >PATH is also outside the purview of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, providing insulation from the authority's financial troubles. (Many New Yorkers' only experience with PATH came when the railroad stayed open during the subway strike of 2005.) The Port Authority has a stronger balance sheet, and the political pressures of a two-state agency have helped keep its fares low. The transportation authority recently approved the third subway fare increase in three years; fares on PATH have gone up twice in the last decade.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Still, subway officials insist they are not envious. Asked whether PATH may siphon away riders with its cheaper fares, Charles Seaton, a subway spokesman, said, ''I don't believe it's ever been a concern.'' He noted that the two were too distinct to compare.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >New York City Transit, the subway's parent agency, includes PATH's ridership figures in its monthly reports to the authority's board. In the 12 months ending in June, PATH's ridership rose at nearly twice the rate of the New York City subway.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Georgia Doyle, who for 20 years has used PATH to commute to Midtown from her home on West 10th Street, said she found it more civilized than the subway. Besides ferrying her each day to her job in the garment district, she said the railroad came with other benefits: ''It's great to go to Jersey on the weekends.''</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The New York Times went so far on opening day as to call the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad ''one of the greatest engineering feats that has ever been accomplished, greater perhaps than the Panama Canal will be when completed.''   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The tunneling had begun a quarter century earlier, under DeWitt Clinton Haskin. The project stopped and started and stopped again, plagued by litigation and bankruptcy, until William G. McAdoo took over.   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >McAdoo was not just the president of the H & M but a figure so synonymous with the system that passengers often spoke simply of riding the ''McAdoo Tubes.''   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >President Roosevelt inaugurated the railroad by pressing a button in his White House office that turned on the electric current in the tunnel. At 3:40:30 p.m., a ceremonial train pulled out of the temporary Manhattan terminus at Sixth Avenue and 19th Street, headed for Hoboken.   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The governors of New Jersey and New York squeezed aboard with other dignitaries. Cornelius Vanderbilt, the commodore's great-grandson, found himself in the unusual position of being just another crushed commuter, but professed, ''I would rather ride under the Hudson today hanging to a strap than ride to Albany in a private car.''   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The train reached Hoboken at 3:51. A crowd of 10,000 gathered outside to cheer the arriving passengers. ''The natural barrier which has separated New York from New Jersey since those States came into existence was, figuratively speaking, wiped away,'' The Times proclaimed.   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The palmy days did not last long, however. The railroad, which had put many Hudson River ferryboats out of business, was undermined in turn by the automobile. Its busiest year was 1927, when it carried 113,141,729 passengers. In other news that year, the Holland Tunnel opened.   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >By the 1950s, the railroad was bankrupt. The Port Authority was persuaded to take it over in 1962 as part of the intricate negotiating in the development of the World Trade Center. In fact, the twin towers rose where the railroad's enormous Hudson Terminal complex once stood, with two massive office buildings that were almost identical.   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On this site, PATH commuters are eventually to arrive in an architectural marvel that may go a long way -- at least symbolically -- toward curing any inferiority they may feel about their subway system. The Port Authority has begun building a $2.2 billion World Trade Center transportation hub and PATH terminal, designed by Santiago Calatrava, a celebrated architect and engineer. It is to open in 2011.   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Even earlier, new cars will start coming into service, to replace PATH's aging fleet, most of which dates from the mid-60s to the 1970s. Anthony R. Coscia, the chairman of the authority, said a total of $3.3 billion was being invested in the expansion and modernization of PATH.   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >PATH also has advertising inside its tunnels. Working on the principle of the 19th-century zoetrope toy, which created the illusion of motion, a company called Submedia has installed a series of illuminated panels with static images on tunnel walls. These blur into a continuous image, what the company calls ''a motion picture outside of the train's windows.''   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On her way to Exchange Place, Ms. Clinton, who is an editorial assistant, allowed that she liked watching those ads. ''That's very cool,'' she said. ''You don't have that in New York.''   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Another thing PATH has that New York City Transit does not is a $1.50 fare. That will rise to $1.75 on March 2, though it will still be cheaper than the basic $2 subway fare, so a frugal commuter traveling between Greenwich Village and Midtown can still save a quarter by using PATH instead of the No. 1 train.   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On Monday morning, however, a PATH employee with a megaphone urged hesitant commuters to push through the turnstiles at the World Trade Center station. ''Free rides today, folks,'' he said. ''Free rides. Through the turnstile. Any turnstile.''   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Eric L. Altschuler, 39, slipped through one of the freely spinning turnstiles, unaware of the centenary and actually a bit leery about a free ride. For two and a half years, he has commuted from Manhattan to Newark, where he is an assistant professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University Hospital.   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''Frankly, unusual things can happen on the trains,'' he explained. ''I'm a typical New Yorker. I wanted to make sure it wasn't a ruse.''   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Once assured that it was purely celebratory, Dr. Altschuler seemed pleased to learn that it was PATH's 100th anniversary and threw in a bit of praise, likening the system to its big-city relation. ''Everybody rides the PATH trains,'' he said. ''It's a whole other world, but it's not a museum. It's alive.''   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >When the H & M opened, the scheduled time between Hoboken and 19th Street, in the heart of the Ladies' Mile shopping district, was 12 minutes. On Friday, this reporter was spirited from Hoboken to 19th Street, having made three intermediate stops, in only 11 minutes. But he could not get off at 19th. That station was abandoned by the financially ailing company in 1954.   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >If one looks carefully and does not blink, the stout columns and vaulted ceilings of the 19th Street passenger platform can still be seen as the train passes through.

The introduction of the unlimited-ride cards was part of the Port Authority's decision last Friday to raise the one-way fare to $1.75, from $1.50. The price for 10-, 20- and 40-ride fare cards will increase to $1.30 per PATH ride, from $1.20.

He was expecting a consistent public policy that encourages people to use mass transit during peak highway traffic while still encouraging them to use E-ZPass when driving at non-peak hours. Instead, he encountered a double standard and limited incentive to use either mass transit or the electronic toll system.   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"I normally take NJ Transit to work from Glen Rock,\" explained Mark, a broadcast technician. \"But on the observed Christmas holiday, the trains were running on a weekend schedule, so if I took mass transit, I would have been late for work.\"   </p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"Does the PA need that extra dollar from people traveling on a holiday morning?\" asked Mark.   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Does it need it from the bridge that is, by far, the most lucrative of the agency's six crossings? Some 50,000 vehicles cross each day during morning rush hour, about 80 percent of them E-ZPass customers. The Port Authority could not provide specifics, but if half these folks use the bridge during the same period on the holiday, an extra dollar's revenue for peak fares would amount to $20,000.   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >That's not much. Maybe the E-ZPass customer service rep was right: It doesn't matter.   </p>\n",

I couldn't comprehend why hundreds of people were running.''   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The customer dropped the knapsack. Without saying a word to each other, the two men joined the flight. After finding sanctuary in the park at 1 Liberty Plaza, Mr. Petroski heard a rumor that the explosion had been caused by a faulty boiler.   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''The store's a bank vault -- a quarter million dollars of inventory,'' he said. ''Responsible district manager that I am, I went back into the World Trade Center. Security is saying, 'Get out!' But I'm smarter than that. I know it's just a boiler. I lock everything up.''   </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >After leaving the concourse again, Mr. Petroski heard a noise getting louder and louder and louder as he crossed Church Street.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But the increased benefit would have a significant impact on other parts of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which raised commuter rail fares last month, the second time in two years.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >If the increased benefit is approved, typical workers who are in the 35 percent combined federal and state tax brackets and spend $200 a month for transportation will save about $650 a year in taxes, about $200 more than the current savings, said Larry Filler, the president of TransitCenter Inc., a nonprofit group that began administering transit benefits for employers in the New York area in 1987. The monthly limit for pretax spending on parking, currently $200, has always been more generous than the transit benefit, a discrepancy that transit advocates have long viewed as unfair.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The president of the American Public Transportation Association, William W. Millar, said a larger deduction would most likely prompt some drivers to switch to mass transit. ''With the price of gasoline going up and up, this will certainly encourage additional riders,'' he said. ''It's one more step to eliminate some of the discrimination that exists in federal tax law and federal transportation policy against mass transit.''  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >However, getting employers and workers to participate in the program remains a daunting challenge.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In a study completed last August, TransitCenter found that only 19 percent of commuters in the New York area participated in transit-benefit programs. In many cases their employers did not offer the benefit. Even in companies where such programs were offered, 32 percent of employees did not participate.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Millar called on transit agencies to increase public awareness of the benefits. He also noted that the first employee transit benefit was introduced in 1984, but only as a tax break for employers that subsidized mass transit commuting costs. ''Free parking was already pretty well established, but free or discounted transit was not well established,'' he said. ''Relatively few employers were looking for ways to add costs.''  </p>\n",

''As many as 10,000 visitors in a single day ride the nonstop express elevators -- from the lobby to the 107th floor in 82 seconds -- to take in the spectacular views.''  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Across Church Street is an 18-foot-high steel cruciform that was found in the wreckage from 6 World Trade Center, which was the United States Custom House.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Turning right on Liberty Street, you will pass 10 House, the recently rebuilt quarters of Engine Company 10 and Ladder Company 10, which lost three firefighters, two lieutenants and a retired captain. Their rugged faces gaze out across ground zero from a bronze memorial plaque. A sign asks passers-by to ''remember that questions about 9/11 tend to bring back horrible memories for many firefighters.''  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Bad memories have physical form on Liberty Street. Through a large opening in the black netting around the 40-story Deutsche Bank building, which is to be dismantled, you can see steel beams and columns installed to repair a 15-story gash created by the falling facade of the south tower. Even more poignant is the grievous injury to the fantastic Gothic facade of 90 West Street, one block closer to the river. But this is now being restored and turned into apartments.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Liberty Street offers the best street-level overlook into ground zero. From here, you can see the remains of the 6 World Trade Center garage, the reconstructed PATH commuter station and the new 7 World Trade Center, under construction, which replaces the third tower that fell on 9/11. Hundreds of steel caps visible in the concrete foundation wall mark the cable anchors that tie the wall to bedrock for reinforcement.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >After crossing the Liberty Street footbridge, stay on the second-level passageway in the World Financial Center. What looks from here like a water pipe sticking out of the foundation wall is actually an abandoned train tunnel built in 1909 by the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad. This should give you an idea of the wall's colossal dimension.  </p>\n",

Compare the two models showing the plan envisioned by Daniel Libeskind in 2003 and the design as it evolved, with the twisting Freedom Tower, the birdlike transportation hub and a landscaped memorial that turns the twin tower outlines into water-filled voids.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The towers in this model stand 6.8 feet tall, large enough to convey something of the three-dimensional impact of the trade center, beginning with the fact that you have to crook your neck slightly to see the top of the towers.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >As you move around the model, the towers change; at one point divided by a column of light, then fused together, then looking like flat slabs, now like silver-edged pinnacles.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >To orient yourself in Lower Manhattan, look for the astonishingly detailed, mural-size aerial photograph of the trade center environs at the south end of the mezzanine. Next to it, in blue, is a corresponding street map.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At the north end are two placards, ''Exchange Place Tunnels, 1907'' and ''Early H & M Railroad Cars.'' Standing at the column between them, looking down through a narrow gap in the translucent screen, you can make out a line of rusting steel squares set into the ground at regular intervals. These are the stub ends of the perimeter columns that once supported the north facade of 1 World Trade Center.  </p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Get off at Exchange Place and catch any inbound train, marked ''WTC.'' As you re-enter Manhattan, you will feel the train slow before daylight breaks in. Next comes a screech of wheels as the cars turn into the station.  </p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Calatrava's design for the permanent World Trade Center PATH terminal, which was unveiled yesterday, is a soaring, sculptural, steel-and-glass shell covering a cathedral-like concourse. Through a network of passageways, the terminal would connect the Port Authority Trans-Hudson underground rail line from New Jersey and 14 subway lines.  </p>\n",

Construction is expected to begin early next year and take four years to complete.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Rather than rely on words alone, Mr. Calatrava took pastels to paper in the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center at Battery Park City. He sketched a child releasing a bird into the air, then superimposed the bird on the outline of the terminal.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >About 67,000 commuters boarded PATH trains at the trade center before the attack. Today, a temporary open-air station is used daily by about 30,000 travelers.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In aesthetics and logistics, Mr. Calatrava's design aspires to be far more than a commuter rail station, vital as that is to Lower Manhattan. Its admirers are already mentioning it in the same breath as the old Pennsylvania Station, which was torn down in the early 1960's, and Grand Central Terminal, which Mr. Calatrava claimed as his ''deepest inspirational object.''  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Like the original Penn Station, the PATH terminal would bathe travelers in daylight, which would reach all the way to the train platforms 60 feet below ground through the use of glass-block floors above. And like Grand Central, it would be a hub of an underground network linking numerous skyscrapers and subway stations.It would also do something neither of the earlier stations did: move.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Two counterpoised canopies over the main concourse, rising some 150 feet like skeletal birds' wings, could be retracted hydraulically in about two minutes to create a tapered opening almost 50 feet wide at its center. This would ventilate smoke from the building in case of fire and provide natural air-conditioning.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''On a beautiful summer day,'' Mr. Calatrava said, ''the building can work not as a greenhouse but as an open space.'' He also envisioned the symbolic power of opening the roof every year on the morning of Sept. 11, ''giving us the sense of unprotection.''  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''The building itself expresses the memory of Sept. 11,'' said Mr. Calatrava, 52, a Spanish architect, engineer and artist who is widely admired for the lyrical quality of his bridges and train stations. Though he has a home on the Upper East Side, the PATH terminal would be Mr. Calatrava's first structure in New York City. (His partners in the design and engineering are DMJM & Harris and the STV Group.)  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The angle of the canopies' outer edges would mark the line of the sun at 8:46 on the morning of Sept. 11, when the first plane struck the trade center. The main axis of the 360-foot-long concourse would be aligned with the angle of the sun at 10:28 that morning, when the second tower collapsed.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >An architectural expression of these angles was called for in the master site plan by Studio Daniel Libeskind. They formed the Wedge of Light plaza on either side of Fulton Street. In the Libeskind plan, the PATH terminal was to be south of the plaza, in the approximate location of Dey Street, adjoining one of the planned office buildings.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Calatrava pulled the terminal northward, making it a free-standing structure surrounded by plazas, thereby reopening Dey Street. Because the terminal integrally expresses the Wedge of Light, its design won a warm endorsement from Mr. Libeskind, who has otherwise been struggling to preserve key elements of his year-old site plan.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >It was also embraced by Nikki Stern, whose husband, James E. Potorti, died in the north tower. After calling up the images of the design to the screen of her computer, she said her first reaction was -- indeed -- ''Wow.''  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''My second reaction was how beautifully it complements Daniel's plan,'' Ms. Stern said, ''and how pleased I am that the Port Authority allowed Calatrava to create something that is respectful, yet so hopeful and functional.''  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >That is not to say that the difficult issues are all resolved. Among them is the extent to which the platforms and tracks of the new terminal will encroach on the footprints of the north and south towers.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The amount of retail space in the 200,000-square-foot terminal will not only affect its character but could potentially drain life from the surrounding streets.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Construction will also have to be coordinated with that of the memorial, the Fulton Street Transit Center being designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and with the office buildings planned by Silverstein Properties, including 62- and 65-story towers on either side of the terminal.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Only two months ago, the $323 million temporary PATH station opened. A month later, the design of the 1,776-foot Freedom Tower was announced. And last week, the design of the memorial, ''Reflecting Absence,'' was made public.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The permanent PATH terminal and its surrounding network of passageways carries the largest price tag of any of these projects: up to $2 billion, financed with $1.7 billion from the Federal Transit Administration and $300 million in insurance proceeds.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Governor Pataki seemed to anticipate criticism of the project as an extravagance when he summoned the memory of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. ''He would lament the fact that we don't build grand things any more,'' Mr. Pataki said.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >So is the more basic matter of bistate cooperation in the common interests of the metropolitan region. In the 78 years since the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was created, that goal has been a given. It seems less certain now. </p>\n",
        "</td></tr><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" class=\"index\"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The immediate issue is whether the Port Authority will renew the lease of two large container-shipping companies, Maersk and Sea-Land. They employ 1,000 people, with a payroll of $100 million, at the Elizabeth Marine Terminal. Together they move a quarter of the containers that pass through the Port of New York every year. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Maersk and Sea-Land want to stay where they are but don't want to pay as much rent as the Port Authority had proposed to charge them. The lines also seek deepening of the channels that lead to their piers, in order to accommodate a new generation of very large vessels. New wharves will be necessary too. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The lines are not without alternatives to the New Jersey terminals. The ports of Baltimore and Halifax are naturally deep enough for the new ships and eager to attract them, and Baltimore, in particular, has offered to build a modern cargo-handling facility for Maersk and Sea-Land, with wharves, cranes, and a rail connection. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The New York-North Jersey region is the biggest consumer market on the East Coast. A port 150 miles distant would be at a disadvantage in serving it. You would assume that shippers would prefer to deliver directly to the heart of the region, rather than transfer containers from ships to trains, and then to tractor-trailers. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Still, Baltimore keeps sweetening its offer, while the situation here has gotten more and more murky. The current problem is New York Gov. George Pataki. He is trying to use the Maersk-Sea-Land negotiations to force a fundamental change in the allocation of Port Authority resources between New York and New Jersey. Basically, he wants more. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >That was not clear last year. The authority offered a new, 29-year lease to the two lines. The offer was formally presented by the authority's operations committee, headed by Charles Gargano, who is vice chairman of the authority board and Pataki's economic development director. In effect, Gargano was acting as Pataki's agent in the negotiations. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In September the lines rejected the offer. The authority went back to the drawing board and came up with a new proposal. But the governor of each state has the power to veto any authority action, and Pataki put the kibosh on this one. Last week Governor Whitman tried to finesse him. She said she would make up the difference between the old offer and the new one, using some of the $300 million in state dredging bonds that New Jersey voters approved in 1996. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Nice try. Pataki said no again, and it became clear that he was not so much opposed to the Maersk-Sea-Land deal as to the basic division of Port Authority resources between the two states. He and the ever-combative New York City mayor, Rudy Giuliani, contend that New York is perennially shortchanged, that New Jersey gets the better of the bistate deal. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Capital-spending statistics don't support that contention. In the last decade, the authority spent $2.8 billion on projects in New York and $1.7 billion in New Jersey, with an additional $2.3 billion spent on interstate facilities.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The New Yorkers say that the bus terminal, despite its location, is really a New Jersey facility, and they have a point. Most of the people who use it live on this side of the Hudson and commute to jobs in the city. So too with the PATH line, which links Newark, Jersey City, and Hoboken to lower and midtown Manhattan. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The line operates at a deficit, a big one. Most mass-transit lines lose money, but there is a special reason this one is so unprofitable. Its fare is only $1, unchanged since 1987. Tom Kean was governor of New Jersey then. He was popular in his second term and ineligible for a third. He could and did permit the fare to rise, from 75 cents. His successors, first Jim Florio and now Whitman, have balked at any further increase, fearing the political consequences. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >They have reason for concern. Nevertheless, New York is no less politicized than New Jersey, and the fare on the city's subways and buses is now $1.50, half again as high as the PATH fare. To cover the line's deficits, the authority uses profits from other facilities, such as the airports and the World Trade Center. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >New Yorkers have a legitimate complaint here. A moderate PATH fare increase is overdue. Pataki seems to have bigger changes in mind, though. He talks vaguely about a restructuring of the authority, with each state assuming responsibility for facilities on its side of the Hudson. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >New York would direct operations at Kennedy and LaGuardia airports and at the World Trade Center. New Jersey would take over Newark International Airport and the container ports. It is not clear what would happen to the truly interstate facilities _ the George Washington Bridge, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, and the three bridges between New Jersey and Staten Island. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >It is hard to tell how serious Pataki is about these notions. They would radically restructure the Port Authority. The region functions economically, culturally, and socially as a unified whole, and the authority has furthered the common interest. It would be a pity to lose that.  </p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But the authority is now being overseen by Gov. George E. Pataki and Gov.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The cuts, intended to avoid an increase in the authority's tolls and commuter railway fare, left a tense scene at the authority's offices in the World Trade Center. In some departments, workers sobbed as they packed up the contents of their desks, saying they were bitter about devoting so many years of their lives to an agency that is now casting them aside.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"I am angry, because when you have been with a company almost nine years, it's almost like it's your second family,\" said Debra Ashe, 35, a senior office assistant at the office of economic and policy analysis, which is being disbanded, doing away with more than 40 jobs. \"It really hurts. You expect to stay here and continue working and retire here one day.\"  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The cuts seemed to sting all the more because the authority was known for nurturing its workers and protecting them from the turmoil that often roils government agencies when new governors or mayors are elected.  </p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The layoffs were such a departure for the authority that it held training sessions for senior officials on Thursday on how to dismiss people. The officials were put through exercises in which they pretended they were telling workers they were being dismissed and then described the benefits the workers were entitled to.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Those being laid off are to remain on the payroll until Oct. 15 and then get a severance package that takes into consideration age and seniority and will average about three months pay per worker, officials said. The authority has also set up a career counseling office that more than 100 workers had visited by last night.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Besides the office of economic and policy analysis, three other areas were hard hit: management and budget; international business, and human resources. George J. Marlin, the authority's executive director, has said that the number of workers in those four areas has grown unwieldy in recent decades.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >He has pointed to those areas as examples of what he says is a tendency for middle managers at headquarters to duplicate tasks being done at the authority's many sites, which include the region's three major airports, six bridges and tunnels, the Port Authority Trans Hudson commuter railway, most of the marine terminals at New York Harbor and the World Trade Center itself.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >When the authority announced the layoffs last week, it said they were the largest, and virtually the only, such cuts in its 74-year history. But Professor Jameson W. Doig of Princeton University, who has studied the authority, said yesterday that it laid off a similar percentage of its work force in the early 1930's, largely because of the Depression.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Senior authority officials said that by last night they had eliminated about 315 positions in this round of cuts, achieving them from the more than 160 layoffs as well as from voluntary departures and from leaving vacant slots open.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The officials said yesterday that they regretted having to undertake the layoffs, but they also insisted that they had no choice.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"It's always painful even when one person has to lose his job, but we feel that this is a vital and necessary first step in moving the Port Authority in a new direction,\" said John J. Haley Jr., the deputy executive director of the authority.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But the workers who were dismissed had few nice words for Mr. Pataki, Mrs. Whitman or the authority's senior management. Many of them questioned why the authority made so many cuts in the middle of the work force and left alone high-ranking officials who allowed the middle to grow in the first place.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"They want to be able say, 'We broke the back of the fat, arrogant Port Authority,' \" said a worker who was laid off in the office of economic and policy analysis and who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"I actually think that there is tremendous fat in this agency. Unfortunately, the real layers of fat are in senior management, but those guys are not going to slit their own throats.\"  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Margie Beck, 28, another employee in the office, agreed, saying that her managers had misled her in recent weeks about how many jobs would be saved. \"They didn't have to let all these people go,\" she said.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Others said their departments had been the focus of so many rumors for so many weeks that they were relieved that it was finally over. Now, they said, they could move on.  </p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Many said they had not yet begun looking for employment because they had thought they might escape the cuts. But now, they said, they would relax for a few days and then plunge into the job market.  </p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >First, the Port Authority Trans Hudson fare of $1 is unjustifiably low compared to the New York City subway fare of $1.25, soon to rise to $1.50. </p>\n",
        "</td></tr><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" class=\"index\"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Second, the PATH fare is low not because the line is cheaper to run but because it is more heavily subsidized. One way or another, through a fare increase or a cut in expenditures or both, the PATH deficit should be reduced. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >No mass transit line in the country makes money. Most are subsidized by taxes. That is not true of PATH. Its deficit is made up by profits on other Port Authority operations, in particular the World Trade Center. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Some history is useful here. Prior to 1962 there was no PATH. We had the Hudson Tubes instead. The tubes were a subway line, much like New York's, that ran from Newark, Hoboken, and Jersey City under the Hudson into Manhattan. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The formal moniker of the tubes was the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad. It was a private corporation. When it was young, it had made money. Those days were long gone. It was bankrupt. The rolling stock was decrepit, the rails and switches rusty, the work force demoralized. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >It was run by a court-appointed trustee, Herman Stichman. He had been lobbying for years, tirelessly but without success, to get the Port Authority to take over the line. The authority's board, packed with bankers, lawyers, and moguls like Charles Engelhard, reacted as to an invitation to donate their wealth to Mother Teresa. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >They were in the business of making money, whether in their private dealings or as custodians of a successful public authority. They did not need to hire a consultant to conclude that the Hudson Tubes would cost the authority a bundle. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Stichman was the most press-accessible business leader on the planet. In the late Fifties I was a night rewriteman in the United Press bureau in Newark. Our Rolodex, like that of every newspaper in North Jersey and New York, included Stichman's home and office phone numbers. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >When some news event occurred that related even remotely to the possibility of a Port Authority takeover of the tubes, you could call Stichman in Manhattan, day or night, and get a response. Once I got him out of bed at 1 o'clock in the morning. He was perfectly affable. He dictated a comment that was pertinent and newsy and closed by saying, \"Thank you.\" </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Stichman had an ally in the governor of New Jersey, Robert Meyner. But Meyner alone couldn't make the Port Authority do something it didn't want to do. Then something happened that gave him some leverage. It involved his opposite number in New York, Nelson Rockefeller, and Nelson's brother David, head of the Chase Manhattan Bank. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The Rockefellers wanted to boost downtown Manhattan. They had an idea for a huge office development, to be called the World Trade Center. The Port Authority would float bonds to build it. The first draft of the plan put the project on the east side of Manhattan. Meyner said no. If the thing was going to be built, he wanted it on the west side, the Hudson River side, where it would be accessible to New Jerseyans. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >He had a specific site in mind, too, one centered on the Lower Manhattan terminal of the Hudson Tubes. As part of the deal the authority would have to assume responsibility for the tubes. Profits on the World Trade Center would help pay the railroad deficit. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The authority board bridled but ultimately assented. Once the authority got into the commuter rail business, it did a thorough job. The tubes were modernized. Today PATH is a clean, efficient operation. But expensive. The $1 fare covers only 36 percent of costs. By comparison, the $1.25 charged passengers on the city subway covers 70 percent of costs. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Money that the Port Authority spends on PATH is money it doesn't have for other projects, including projects favored by Mayor Giuliani. The present, Republican governors of the two states are resisting a fare increase. They contend the authority is wasteful. Maybe so. Apparently savings can be realized on PATH operations. Sooner or later, though, the fare will have to be raised. Eighty-five percent of the passengers live in New Jersey. There will be a hullabaloo. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The case for a fare increase is set out in a position paper prepared for Giuliani by his chief planner, Joseph Rose, who also calls for a big toll increase on the George Washington Bridge and the Lincoln and Holland tunnels. The present toll is $4. City bridges like the Whitestone, the Triborough, and the Verrazano charge $6 now for a round-trip, with a $1 increase in prospect. Bridge profits help subsidize the city subway. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Again, some toll increase would appear warranted, although a $2 raise, much less $3, isn't going to happen soon. This might be an opportune time to experiment with rush-hour surcharges. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >What isn't acceptable is Rose's argument that because New York City has 47 percent of the population of the metropolitan region, compared to 28 percent for North and Central Jersey, the city deserves more Port Authority money than the New Jersey counties. This misconceives the basic nature of the bistate arrangement. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >It was, and is, a partnership of equals. New Jersey never would have thrown in with New York in the Port Authority compact of 1921 if this state would be a junior partner. Both states have benefited from the arrangement.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Catucci and others say they cannot understand how the Planning Department could express such doubts only months after the city and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates most of the city's marine terminals, had spent tens of millions of dollars to reopen the Howland Hook Marine Terminal on Staten Island.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Though it was released last week, the recommendation attracted little notice at first because it was buried in a report that was put together to buttress the Giuliani administration's contention that the Port Authority was biased toward New Jersey and must be reorganized.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani cited the report last week when he fired the first shot in a border war with New Jersey, saying the Port Authority should raise the fare on the Port Authority Trans-Hudson, or PATH, commuter railway and the tolls on its bridges and tunnels in order to give more revenue to the city.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Though the Mayor focused on how much the PATH loses annually -- about $200 million -- he failed to note that the report also questions whether the losses on the marine terminals in New York City should be allowed to mount. The major terminals run by the Port Authority in New Jersey turn a collective profit, the Planning Department said. It is not clear where Mr. Giuliani stands on the terminals, but senior administration officials said the report was privately denounced by the city's Economic Development Corporation, which oversees the terminals.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The report said that after some study, the city and the authority might still conclude that the losses were justified or might decide that new investments should be made. But the city and the authority should also determine \"whether there are other uses for the marine terminals that would make more economic sense,\" the report said.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In an interview, Joseph B. Rose, director of the Planning Department and chairman of the City Planning Commission, emphasized that he was not calling for the shutting of the terminals. And he said the recommendations about the terminals had to be seen as part of an overall assessment of the Port Authority, which was the purpose of the report.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >All the Port Authority's money-losing ventures, including the PATH line and the Port Authority Bus Terminal, should be scrutinized, he said.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"A lot of the marine investments have to be re-evaluated, in the same way that you re-evaluate the PATH and the industrial parks, and the World Trade Center,\" Mr. Rose said. \"Are these investments and these subsidies operating in such a way that they have the benefit that they were intended to have?\"  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Rose also said he thought Howland Hook had more potential than the other terminals, particularly those in Brooklyn, many of which have not had tenants for years.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Peter Yerkes, a spokesman for the Port Authority, declined to comment yesterday on the report, but officials outside the Giuliani administration have not been reticent.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, a Democratic whose district includes parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, sent a letter to Mr. Giuliani in which he praised the Mayor for attacking the Port Authority but also criticized the report's assertions about the marine terminals.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Nadler, a proponent of building a large containerized shipping port in Brooklyn, told Mr. Giuliani that the city should not give up on its maritime industry.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"Rather than precipitously concluding (as the city planning report seems to do) that these terminals should be closed, there should be a public discussion of whether subsidies to these terminals make sense,\" Mr. Nadler wrote. \"If such a debate were to take place, I am confident that the conclusion would be reached that some of these facilities (particularly those along the Brooklyn waterfront) could be made profitable.\"  </p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Giuliani doubtlessly knew that by demanding a fare increase, he would stir anger in New Jersey.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The last time the authority considered an increase, it became entangled in a battle that lasted two years. From 1989 to 1991, two New Jersey Governors, Thomas H. Kean and Jim Florio, repeatedly rejected an increase as politically unpalatable.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The authority is now seeking to do that by starting a hiring freeze and putting together plans that could end up trimming its staff of 9,000 workers by 5 percent to 10 percent, officials said.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But unless the authority slices off significant parts of its budget, many of its costs, particularly those tied to labor, will keep growing even as revenues from tolls and fares are staying relatively flat. In other words, minor cuts may not solve a structural problem in the budget, so the issue of an increase may continue to dog the agency.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At the same time, though, if Governor Whitman vetoes an increase this year, she is not likely to approve one next year because it is too close to 1997, when she has to run for re-election.  </p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The college's Supreme Court brief, prepared by the New York State Attorney General's office, asked the Justices to decide whether \"a person who has publicly engaged in speech thought to be detrimental to the purpose and nature of a public university\" had a First Amendment right to retain his position. \"This case challenges the authority of university administrators to decide who may speak for the university,\" the brief said.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In urging the Court not to review the case, Dr. Jeffries's lawyer, Joseph Fleming, said that no harm had come to City College as a result of the speech, which Dr. Jeffries made in July 1991 to the Empire State Black Arts and Cultural Festival in Albany.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"What did happen was that there was an increase in the level and intensity of research and debate following the Speech,\" Mr. Fleming told the Court. \"This, one would think, would be welcomed in an academic institution.\"  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The Court's decision today, neither to hear the case itself nor to let the appeals court's ruling stand, was a surprising disposition of a case that the Justices had kept under active consideration since the term began six weeks ago.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >It had the earmarks of a compromise between Justices who argued for taking the case and those who wanted to deny it. Given the pace at which the Court reviews the more than 7,000 appeals that come in every year, it is unusual for a case to linger for more than two or three weeks without being acted on.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan will not necessarily have an easy time in carrying out the Justices' instruction to reconsider its earlier decision. While the intervening Supreme Court decision, Waters v. Churchill, bears on the question of public employees' First Amendment rights, it arose in a very different context from the Jeffries dispute.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The Court was deeply split in the Waters case, which concerned a public hospital's dismissal of a nurse who had criticized a training program. A Federal appeals court ruled in the nurse's favor in her First Amendment suit against the hospital, ruling that despite the hospital administrators' concern, there was no evidence that the criticism had disrupted the workplace.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The Supreme Court, in a plurality opinion by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, vacated that decision on the ground that the administrators' \"reasonable predictions\" of disruption should have received more weight in balancing the employee's rights against the employer's needs.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >City College cited the Waters case in its Supreme Court appeal, telling the Justices that the decision's message was that university administrators should prevail in lawsuits like Dr. Jeffries's \"where they were motivated by a reasonable expectation that the speaker's words would harm the university.\"  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On campus, several teachers and students interviewed today said that they were not surprised by the court's decision. \"The Supreme Court was stacked against Jeffries,\" said Barry Solomon-Lufti, 49, who teaches science.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"It doesn't take a pound of intelligence to know there is a thing called free speech, but it's not applied to black people,\" said Mr. Solomon-Lufti, who is black.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Others, though, said they believed the issues involved were not clear-cut. \"I don't think Jeffries should have been kicked out for what he said, but I am kind of confused about whether his right to free speech was violated,\" said Lisa Seay, 27, an education major who is black.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The Court also took these other actions today in a busy day for the New York area: Port Authority Suits  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The Court ruled, 5 to 4, that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is not constitutionally entitled to immunity from suit in Federal court.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The decision revived negligence suits against the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation by two PATH employees who were injured in separate accidents.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The Justices took this case, Hess v. Port Authority, No. 93-1197, to resolve a conflict between two Federal appeals courts over the immunity issue. The constitutional provision at issue was the 11th Amendment, which bars suits by individuals against states in Federal court.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Writing for the majority today, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that the Port Authority's financial independence from New York and New Jersey -- which have no legal liability for its debts -- meant that there was no reason for it to share the immunity the states themselves would enjoy. Real Estate Solicitations  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Without comment, the Court refused to hear New York State's appeal of a ruling that its regulations aimed at preventing blockbusting in racially mixed neighborhoods were unconstitutional.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The Second Circuit ruled in June that orders issued by Secretary of State Gail S. Shaffer barring real estate agents from soliciting business in specified portions of New York City and Nassau County violated the real estate agents' right to commercial speech. This case was Shaffer v. New York State Association of Realtors, No. 94-530.  </p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >As the day ended, a series of investigations began -- into the cause of the explosion and its possible perpetrators, and into what went wrong in what many called a botched evacuation, with no alarms and no instructions for thousands caught in dark, smoky stairwells, in stark contrast to carefully laid plans.  </p>\n",

Dinkins, visiting in Osaka, Japan, was notified by City Hall and, in a telephone news conference, called the Fire Department response the largest for any non-natural disaster in the city's history.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Many of those who walked down scores of flights from the upper reaches of the trade center towers said there had been no alarm bells and no instructions from building personnel or emergency workers.

By early evening the police said five had been killed while the medical service said seven were dead. Several hours later the police increased the number to seven, but shortly after 11 P.M., the police scaled back the figure to five, saying they could not confirm the medical service's report of seven fatalities. There was no clear explanation for the discrepancies.  </p>\n",

Suddenly, the desk rose up, came down and landed on top of him. But its well protected him from a rain of falling debris. \"The furniture collapsed, the walls collapsed, the ceiling collapsed,\" he said. \"There was total blackness. I thought I was dead.\"  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Later, wading through knee-deep water amid gas pipelines danging overhead in the garage, a cadre of firefighters, police officers and other rescue workers found two bodies in a lunchroom used by mechanics, another body in the mangled wreckage of a car, and more victims under the debris in the garage.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The five victims -- three men, one woman and one unidentified -- were all believed to heve been killed by the blast. They were not immediately identified but the Port Authority said that they were all believed to be authority workers or people working under contract to the agency. The authorities said that more bodies might be found in the rubble as the search went on.  </p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Meantime, as several fires erupted around the scene of the explosion, heavy smoke billowed up through the corridors, elevator shafts and stairwells of the trade center. Because of the time, shortly after noon, many workers were at lunch at nearby restaurants or at fast-food outlets on the ground floor, from where they easily escaped.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But the police estimated that as many as 50,000 people -- workers, tourists and other visitors were still in the building, many of them trapped on the highest floors -- and it was not merely the blast that shook the entire complex, not merely the growing volumes of smoke pouring upward, that frightened them.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Darkness and the unknown perils that awaited them below added to the fears. Much of the power to the trade center had been knocked out by the blast -- Consolidated Edison said four of its eight feeder cables to the center were shut down.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >And within an hour, at the request of the Fire Department, which was trying to protect rescue workers and firefighters in dangerous areas, all power to the trade center was shut off by Con Edison, as well as natural gas and steam to the complex, which houses thousands of offices in six buildings bounded by Church, West, Liberty and Vesey Streets.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Pat Richardi, a Con Edison spokeswoman, said that no hazardous materials, such as polychlorinated biphenals, were in any of the transformers or cables of the trade center, which was completed 22 years ago.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Many of the people climbing down stairs told of having to stop frequently because of panic below; some let pregnant women and old people go through; some nearly passed out with exhaustion; others told of tense minutes in which they sat down on the steps, trying to regain breath in stifling, smoky air.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"It was like sardines, cattle, a herd,\" said Larry Bianculli, 31, of Hicksville, L.I., who walked down 104 floors with his wool scarf over his sooty face.  </p>\n",

Firefighter Bill Chupa, 40, of Ladder 20, said many people were trapped in elevators and screaming for help. He said firefighters broke open elevator doors and found people in groups of 8 or 10, lying in darkness on the floor to escape the smoke.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >After freeing those in elevators, the rescuers turned to the stairwells and began escorting people down.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The Governor, who was in Albany, said President Clinton had called him to express concern and offer aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Mr. Cuomo also raised some questions: \"What emergency devices were available? Did they work? Why were there no lights? Why were there no public announcements. The Port Authority will be called upon to answer, and I'm sure they will.\"  </p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Other bold initiatives are unlikely, Mr. Brezenoff said, because of the economic climate -- the agency's revenues are essentially flat -- and because it will cost at least $3 billion to rebuild the airports.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"I wish we were here when it looked like the sky's the limit,\" Mr. Leone said. \"The major thing we are doing is exercising a certain amount of prudence.\" Still a Leader, But Quite Vulnerable  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The retooling of the Port Authority comes at a particularly vulnerable time. Besides the ordinary cycles of the economy, the agency confronts broad economic and geopolitical forces that have enabled other regions to compete more effectively with the New York area than at any time this century.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Just last year, New York and New Jersey were eclipsed by Los Angeles as the nation's largest maritime port. The port, which consists primarily of huge container shipping terminals on the waterfronts of Newark and Elizabeth, N.J., has grown far more slowly over the last decade than a half-dozen other ports on the East and West Coasts. But it is still ranked second in the value of cargo that it handles.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Kennedy Airport is still the country's leading center for air cargo. But the deregulation of the airline industry and the growth of other regional airports as trans-Atlantic gateways, including those in Washington, Atlanta, Chicago and Boston, has cut into the proportion of domestic travelers who come to Kennedy to board flights to Europe and beyond. This year Kennedy accounted for 40 percent of the trans-Atlantic passengers departing from the United States, down from 50 percent in 1985, according to the Port Authority.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The difficulties of getting into and out of Kennedy, which is now 30 years old, and is somewhat run-down in appearance, do not enhance its image or that of the region, many critics say.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"It's embarrassing,\" said George Sternlieb, a professor emeritus at Rutgers University and former director of the university's Center for Urban Research. \"You go down to Florida and you look at Tampa-St. Pete, for example, and we look like an old-age home.\"  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Plans to rebuild Kennedy, drawn up four years ago, centered on the construction of a $1 billion central terminal that would connect passengers to individual airline terminals by a monorail. The new terminal, along with the monorail, was canceled last year because the financially pressed airlines, which would have borne most of the cost, could not afford it. Facing Wider Needs With Limited Ability  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Some critics say these problems indicate that the Port Authority's difficulties are far deeper than the recession. They contend that the agency no longer has the financial wherewithal, the vision or the political muscle to represent the long-term interests of the New York region.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"It has gone from being an autonomous agency to being a collection of what used to be competence,\" Dr. Sternlieb said. \"Still very heavy in terms of overhead, it's an old-fashioned steam engine that for the moment is just sort of lying in the scrap heap, with people occasionally ripping off the pieces.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"Conceptually, it's never been more needed than now,\" Dr. Sternlieb said. \"It should be the spearhead to provide some regional leadership. What the region is missing is leadership, someone to sell the region.\"  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But others maintain that the outlook is less bleak than it appears. They say that it is vitally important for the agency to focus its efforts on the airports, and that Kennedy could be made much better even without a new main terminal.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Many academics and planners who monitor the Port Authority also said the new emphasis on providing mass transit lines to the airports represented a major, and welcome, departure.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"The airports are now far more important to the region than ever,\" said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of planning at New York University and director of the university's Urban Research Center. \"The airports are more important to the economy today than the seaports were 100 years ago. They are the modern day equivalent of the steamships and railroads tied into one.\"  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Stephen Berger, who ran the Port Authority between 1985 and 1990, is credited with shifting the agency's attention back to the airports.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"Steve Berger was important,\" Professor Moss said, \"because he got the Port Authority back to basics, back to infrastructure, back to the airports and transportation.\" Mr. Brezenoff and Mr. Leone \"are going to build on Berger,\" he said.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Historically, the Port Authority grew into a $1.7 billion-a-year enterprise because of the rise of the automobile and the airplane. Revenue from tolls at the George Washington Bridge, the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels and the three bridges connecting New Jersey and Staten Island -- along with money from the airports and from the World Trade Center, which is also owned by the authority -- have underwritten many other agency activities, including the Port Authority Trans-Hudson line and the economic development projects.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The Port Authority was often more sympathetic to the demands of automobile drivers than to planners' longing for more mass transit to ease the area's clogged highways, several experts said. Many people see a new receptivity to rail transit under Mr. Leone and Mr. Brezenoff.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"I sense a new openness and a willingness to consider more than the bottom line,\" said Richard T. Anderson, president of the Regional Plan Association, a research and advocacy group.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Several Port Authority officials said that even with the rise in international travel from other American airports, the region's airports were holding their own. While losing its proportion of international passenger traffic, Kennedy is still very much No. 1, said David Z. Plavin, the Port Authority's director of aviation.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Plavin also said Kennedy would be rebuilt, even without the central terminal, so that people could move into and around the airport more easily. For example, the airport's road system is being reconfigured, dividing access to terminals into quadrants so cars and buses no longer have to circle the entire airport, contributing to massive traffic jams, just to get to their destinations.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >And earlier this month, three major airlines that have used Kennedy's International Arrivals terminal for decades -- Japan Airlines, Lufthansa and Air France -- said they wanted to build a new terminal at the site of a building abandoned last year by Eastern Airlines.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At La Guardia, the main terminal is being rebuilt, and a new terminal under construction at the airport's eastern end, next to the Trump Shuttle, should be open next spring, Mr. Plavin said. Branching Out With Mixed Results  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >While the Port Authority has spent significant amounts of money in the 1980's on the airports, particularly Newark, much of the agency's intellectual and political capital was expended on new economic development projects, like industrial parks and incinerators.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The agency's top executives, along with the Governors of New York and New Jersey, wanted the agency to branch out. Industrial parks were created in the South Bronx, Yonkers and Elizabeth, N.J., in response to the Governors' desire for the authority to help more with regional economic development.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The legal center in downtown Newark was built only after Thomas H. Kean, then the New Jersey Governor, said the agency should commit itself to the project if it wanted his support for a 1983 toll increase, a former Port Authority official said.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The overall results were mixed. An incinerator in Newark is performing two technological miracles: burning garbage to create electricity, and making money for the Port Authority in the process. But the agency has worked for a decade to create huge office and residential developments on the waterfronts of Hoboken, Brooklyn Heights and Hunters Point, Queens. So far, not a brick has been laid.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Peter C. Goldmark Jr., who as executive director between 1977 and 1985 presided over the Port Authority's era of expansion, said it was not surprising that the track record was uneven.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"If you try different things, some of them aren't going to work,\" he said. \"If you're only going to play if you bat a thousand, don't even come to the ballpark.\"  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Goldmark, who now heads the Rockefeller Foundation, said the Port Authority should pursue more of the kinds of difficult, capital-intensive, long-term projects that it does best. He said the agency should build more industrial parks, get involved in hazardous waste disposal and consider helping to repair the city's public works, particularly the East River bridges.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"I think our fundamental problem is that the political leadership doesn't know what to ask of the Port Authority,\" he said.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But others think that less should be asked, so the agency can concentrate on its primary responsibilities. Mr. Berger, who succeeded Mr. Goldmark, said he thought that real estate and industrial parks and incinerators could be left to other government agencies and the private sector.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"By putting a lot of intellectual energy into these areas, you really didn't do what was crucial -- putting money into the basic infrastructure,\" he said.  </p>\n",

All right, but is a $300 million monorail the best solution? Would a modest buses-only lane work? Is another, unacknowledged agenda at work here? The monorail would supplement and enhance the feasibility of a second, connecting monorail line, from Newark to the airport and on to Elizabeth. The second line has been proposed as a tool with which to encourage development in the two cities. </p>\n",

In 1987 the airport handled 29 million passengers and the authority was predicting 45 million by the year 2000. Today the airport is down to 21 million passengers a year. True, some of the decline is attributable to the demise of People Express, a one-shot phenomenon. Still, the year 2000 is only a decade away. Is usage of Newark Airport going to double by then? </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The Port Authority, which used to have an image as the one governmental entity in the Metropolitan Region that really worked, has not been doing well lately.

To hold down toll collectors' overtime it closed some toll lanes on the Hudson River crossings _ in rush hours. And then it stopped selling commuter discount tickets at toll plazas and gas stations.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Spano said it was ''clear from the Taiwanese they are looking at a substantial percentage of American participation to lower the trade deficit of $19 billion.''  </p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Browning said that the American delegation inluded six officials of United Rail as well as Francis T.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. LaRocco issued an invitation to the Taiwanese authorities to visit the PATH system because United Rail has supplied new cars for PATH, as well as refurbishing old ones, ''and because the PATH fleet of about 350 cars will be similar in size to Taipei's,'' Mr. Browning said.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The PATH commuter subway system links midtown Manhattan and the Wall Street area with Hoboken and Newark in New Jersey.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''As for the specifications of the cars, he told us the design would be based most closely on the subway cars in Singapore,'' also a new system.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Spano said the contract would represent ''a real shot in the arm for expansion of the plant.'' Yonkers has designated the area that includes the plant as an Economic Development Zone, part of an effort to compete for state assistance. If the Yonkers site is among those picked by a state commission, companies setting up business or expanding would receive a 10 percent reduction on state corporate taxes, credit on capital-growth taxes, full refunds of sales taxes on building materials, a 3 percent reduction of utility bills for nonretail businesses and an exemption from real property taxes on a sliding scale over 10 years.  </p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In addition to the 300 jobs that would be guaranteed at the Yonkers rail car plant, he said, ''at least 500 other jobs in the local economy are attributable to this plant's continued viability.''  </p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >It built 95 cars, Mr. Browning said, and the last one was delivered two months ago. ''We built most of the PATH cars in the Yonkers plant, instead of just assembling them,'' he said, adding that it was still the only United States plant capable of making cars from the ground up.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The first five PATH cars were built in Kawasaki's plant in Kobe, Japan, while the Yonkers plant contract was being negotiated. The next 33 were ''kit'' cars - car bodies from Kobe, assembly in Yonkers - and the final 57 cars were built completely in Yonkers.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''That would be our basis for the Taiwan contract, completely manufacturing the cars,'' according to Mr. Browning, who said it was the Port Authority's goal to encourage manufacturing in the port district, which he described as within 25 miles of the Statue of Liberty.  </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Kawasaki has since assembled 325 R-62 cars used on on New York City's Lexington Avenue IRT line. Mr. Browning said, ''It was a very successful order, producing cars with the best mean times between failures in the system.'' The plant is now assembling 200 cars for the Independent and BMT lines, the first ones to be delivered this year.  </p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But Kelly said the work could not be done until a quick and reliable service shop was opened by the Port Authority two years ago.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The old Hudson and Manhattan Railroad _ the Hudson Tubes _ was acquired by the Port Authority on Sept. 1, 1962, after the bistate agency received contractual assurance that the debt-ridden operation would not hurt its credit rating or ability to finance other projects. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >PATH has experienced a twofold rise in patronage over the last days of the Hudson Tube. Its passenger volume is comparable to that of the larger Bay Area Rapid Transit in San Francisco. PATH officials expect 2,000 to 4,000 new riders a year through the mid-1990's, a heavy burden for a system that has reached peak-period capacity. </p>\n",

Dobrow, president of the Committee for Better Transit, a commuter lobby concerned with New York and New Jersey travel, said the Port Authority is more devoted to autos and lucrative economic development projects than to PATH. </p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The Port Authority, Dobrow said, has resisted extending tracks to Newark International Airport. The airport, which is run by the agency, is one of the fastest-growing in the country and offers limited public transportation. </p>\n",
