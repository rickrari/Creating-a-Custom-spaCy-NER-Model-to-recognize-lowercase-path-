# Creating-a-Custom-spaCy-NER-Model-to-recognize-lowercase-path-
Python project that creates a custom spaCy model capable of identifying "path" as an ORG, when "path" stands for Port Authority Trans Hudson (PATH)

This Python project creates a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) spaCy model capable of recognizing lowercase instances of “path”, when “path” stands for Port Authority Trans Hudson (PATH). PATH is a subway that connects northern New Jersey to Manhattan, it is owned and operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PA). The PA is the only funder of PATH, the system does not receive local tax support, but may need such support in the future. To receive local taxes, PATH will need to better understand how leaders in the region view it. This project advances that goal. Most forms of textual analysis require cleaning the data by putting all text into lowercase, meaning without a model capable of recognizing “path” as an organization (ORG) it would not be possible to use python textual analysis to assess public sentiment toward PATH, related topics mentioned along-side PATH, and leaders or communities that hold strong opinions of the transit system. The model created in this project is only exploratory, and further research can improve the model and connect it to existing spaCy models capable of recognizing almost all entities.
