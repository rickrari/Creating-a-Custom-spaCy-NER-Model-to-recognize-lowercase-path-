republican governors, new york and new jersey are increasingly at odds over whether to raise the tolls on six bridges and tunnels that connect the two states, as well as the fare on the path commuter railway. officials in new jersey are lining up against a higher path fare and tolls, fearful of angering their constituents, who use these services more than new yorkers do. but many of their new york counterparts favor raising at least some of these fees, which, they maintain, are being kept artificially low. the issue is flaring now because of a budget deficit at the port authority of new york and new jersey, the bistate agency that runs the path and the six crossings: the george washington bridge, the lincoln and holland tunnels and the three bridges between staten island and new jersey. the port authority tolls have not risen since 1991, and the path, or port authority trans-hudson, fare has been $1 since 1987. and earlier this year, just before he left office, the authority's executive director, stanley brezenoff, predicted that there would have to be increases if the agency were to solve its budget problems. many new york officials say they are acutely aware of how long the port authority tolls and path fare have stayed put, even as subway and bus fares and other tolls in new york city keep rising. \\\"it seems to me only fair that there should be some level of parity between these systems,\\\" said melvin l. schweitzer, a port authority board member from new york who is a strong supporter of raising the tolls and fare. another new york board member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also endorsed raising the tolls, though he was more hesitant about changing the path fare, saying it might reduce ridership. there are six board members from each state, and some have not announced their positions. but people who are familiar with the board's deliberations say the new york side is leaning more toward increases than the new jersey side. many new jersey officials reject any link between the policies of the port authority and those of the metropolitan transportation authority, a new york state agency, which recently moved to raise subway and bus fares in new york city by 25 cents to $1.50, and round-trip tolls on its major bridges and tunnels by $1 to $7. by comparison, the toll at the bridges and tunnels run by the port authority is $4, paid by drivers entering new york. \\\"whatever we do is independent of any other agency, either in new york or new jersey,\\\" said the port authority chairwoman, kathleen a. donovan of new jersey. \\\"just because fares go up in new york, that doesn't mean we want to raise fares.\\\" the debate over the increases, always politically wrenching, could drag on for months, pitting officials from the two states against each other and drawing in groups representing drivers, mass-transit advocates, environmentalists, industry and others. it could be settled quietly and without rancor, but if the past is any guide, that is unlikely. gov. george e. pataki of new york and gov. christine todd whitman of new jersey, either of whom could veto an increase approved by the authority's board, have not announced where they stand yet. but interviews with their senior aides suggest that the governors' views may be diverging. the governors have already had one disagreement over the port authority. in january, mr. pataki angered mrs. whitman when he named george j. marlin to be mr. brezenoff's successor without first consulting with her. many new york officials complain that even though the subway and bus fare is to be $1.50 under the m.t.a.'s recent proposal, the path fare is still $1 because path is far more subsidized than the subways. like some other new york officials, mr. schweitzer said the authority had to find a way to reduce the deficit on the path, which loses about $200 million a year. \\\"why is it that we have to continue to subsidize the path to such an extent?\\\" asked mr. schweitzer, who contends that the rail line drains money that the port authority could use for much-needed projects in both states. his arguments were echoed by deputy mayor john s. dyson of new york city. he said that he had consulted with many of the six new york members of the port authority's board and that they were at the very least receptive to an increase in the path fare. \\\"our view is that the path train price ought to be the same as the city subways',\\\" mr. dyson said. \\\"the plain strategic fact of the matter is unless this disproportionate path subsidy is changed drastically there will never be money to do the things that we need done on this side of the river.\\\" and the senior pataki official who oversees the port authority, louis r. tomson, said the administration could not ignore the differences between the m.t.a.'s fees and the port authority's. \\\"it is a large disparity and the question then is whether that disparity is justified,\\\" he said. \\\"if the subway fare goes to $1.50, it is going to cause everyone to look harder at the path fare.\\\" depending on how the calculations are done, fares currently cover 47 percent to 59 percent of the cost of the subway and bus system, and 25 percent to 38 percent of the cost of the path, officials said. the percentage figure for the new york city system will go up if the increase to $1.50 receives final approval. new jersey officials, in addition to leaders of environmental and transportation groups, point out that path, which runs from newark to jersey city to manhattan, benefits new york by giving commuters a cheap way of reaching jobs, particularly on wall street. it also provides an alternative to driving, reducing congestion and pollution. and they say raising the path fare by 25 cents, to $1.25, would be largely symbolic, generating only about $15 million a year, hardly a dent in the port authority's $2.7 billion budget. a path increase coupled with a $1 increase on the tolls would yield an extra $140 million a year, officials said. ed lloyd, general counsel for the tri-state transportation campaign, a coalition of advocacy groups, said new york officials who favored a rise in the path fare were using skewed logic. the subsidy for path is in line with those for similar mass-transit systems around the nation, he said, while the subsidy for new york's subway and bus system is the lowest subsidy for any major system in the country. \\\"there is a sort of false notion of parity,\\\" mr. lloyd said. \\\"new york is making a bad policy decision in increasing subway fares, and now they are looking for political cover by saying you should increase path as well.\\\" the last time the authority considered an increase, it became entangled in a battle that lasted two years. from 1989 to 1991, two new jersey governors, thomas h. kean and jim florio, repeatedly rejected an increase as politically unpalatable. finally, mr. florio relented halfway, allowing the tolls to rise to $4 from $3 but refusing to budge on the path fare. governor whitman, who has made her mark by cutting her state's income taxes by 30 percent, has said she considers raising any kind of toll or fare akin to a tax increase. mrs. whitman, as well as mrs. donovan and some other port authority board members from new jersey, say they would give their approval only as a last resort after the authority first tried to close its budget gap by cutting spending. the authority is now seeking to do that by starting a hiring freeze and putting together plans that could end up trimming its staff of 9,000 workers by 5 percent to 10 percent, officials said. but unless the authority slices off significant parts of its budget, many of its costs, particularly those tied to labor, will keep growing even as revenues from tolls and fares are staying relatively flat. in other words, minor cuts may not solve a structural problem in the budget, so the issue of an increase may continue to dog the agency. at the same time, though, if governor whitman vetoes an increase this year, she is not likely to approve one next year because it is too close to 1997, when she has to run for re-election. the position of governor pataki, who is in his first year, is not known, and if his role in the the debate over the m.t.a. decision is any indication, he may choose to remain on the sidelines. it is a political rule of thumb that elected officials often agree to raising fees in their first year of office because by the time re-election rolls around, voters may have forgotten about it. chart: \\\"getting around: a closer look at the port authority\\\" shows revenues from port authority bridges, tunnels and path in 1994, fares for the new york city subway system and round-trip tolls for area crossing from 1970 to 1995. (source: port authority of new york and new jersey, metropolitan transit authority)(pg. 22)\",\"1\":\"it has taken a quarter century of sporadic train delays and equipment failures, but the port authority trans-hudson rail system _ path _ is gaining the confidence of riders and critics. \\\"the system is beginning to improve, noticeably so,\\\" said douglas john bowen, vice-president of the new jersey association of railroad passengers, a west orange-based rider advocacy group, with more than 200 members. on the eve of the 25th anniversary of the port authority's purchase of path _ the rail link that carries 210,000 commuters per day between northern new jersey and lower and midtown manhattan _ critics say the widespread deterioration that afflicted the system is a thing of the past. critics also say worsening traffic at hudson river bridge and tunnel crossings operated by the port authority of new york and new jersey has prompted a monetary commitment to improving path. the bistate agency is spending $200 million for 95 modern silvery cars with double doors and added seating. two thirds of the new cars have been placed in service, and an extra car is being added to every train, bringing 20 percent more capacity. in addition, the fleet of 248 path cars dating back to 1965 is being refurbished. the program, however, is a year behind schedule and will not be completed before next spring. about 80 of the rehabilitated cars are in service. figures show the port authority may be putting the skids on delays and breakdowns, but officials acknowledged it's too early to tell for sure. in 1986, the incidents resulting in delays or temporary removal of trains rose to 1,431 _ 190 more than the number experienced in 1984. an \\\"incident\\\" can be anything from a broken door _ a common malady of overcrowded trains _ to problems with brakes, air-conditioning, and lighting. the latest figures show problems leveling off _ an average 121 incidents a month between january and july, compared with 120 during the same period in 1986. \\\"for a while there, we were in the worst position a rail operation could find itself, with a downward trend of available and reliable cars and a steady increase in ridership,\\\" said richard r. kelly, vice- president and general manager of the path corporation. \\\"but we're getting back on track.\\\" path officials acknowledged that problems could have been avoided with a schedule of preventive maintenance, phased in, instead of a crash program requiring reliance on 38 vintage-1958 cars. but kelly said the work could not be done until a quick and reliable service shop was opened by the port authority two years ago. the shop, in jersey city, is a companion to an older, less efficient shop, also in jersey city. another factor was the contracting of private companies to overhaul trains, a procedure that began four years ago. \\\"i find path generally reliable,\\\" said hyman sprekman, an attorney for equitable life, as he waited on the hoboken platform one morning last week for the train to west 33rd street in manhattan. among a half-dozen passengers interviewed, none voiced major complaints about service, although a few said blackouts and loss of air-conditioning is still too common for comfort. path, a 14-mile, 1,130-employee operation, runs trains above ground, below ground, and under the hudson river _ in newark, harrison, jersey city, and hoboken. the manhattan stops are at the world trade center and between christopher street to 33rd street on the west side. the old hudson and manhattan railroad _ the hudson tubes _ was acquired by the port authority on sept. 1, 1962, after the bistate agency received contractual assurance that the debt-ridden operation would not hurt its credit rating or ability to finance other projects. path has experienced a twofold rise in patronage over the last days of the hudson tube. its passenger volume is comparable to that of the larger bay area rapid transit in san francisco. path officials expect 2,000 to 4,000 new riders a year through the mid-1990's, a heavy burden for a system that has reached peak-period capacity. officials also are counting on new forms of transit, outside of path, to absorb the 80,000 more new jersey commuters to manhattan expected by the turn of the century. options include a planned port authority ferry service, at least three years from reality; a proposed trolley along the new jersey waterfront; and direct train service from the hackensack meadowlands to penn station in new york, which is envisioned by nj transit. for now, critics say path could do more to encourage people to use mass transit to manhattan, particularly during the off-peak times. on weekends, no direct service operates between hoboken and the world trade center, despite the proximity to south street seaport, battery park, and other downtown attractions. weekend travel to pavonia station in jersey city also remains difficult even though a new shopping mall has opened above ground. \\\"the lack of off-peak service is a disincentive,\\\" bowen said. \\\"with new commercial developments like the pavonia mall and newport {a massive commercial and residential project in jersey city}, path has a golden opportunity to attract weekend riders with more frequent trains.\\\" while rush-hour service is every three minutes, bowen said, off-peak service ranges from one train every 30 minutes _ a \\\"disaster\\\" _ to one every 15 minutes, \\\"which is only in the ballpark of acceptability for a major rail system.\\\" stephen b. dobrow, president of the committee for better transit, a commuter lobby concerned with new york and new jersey travel, said the port authority is more devoted to autos and lucrative economic development projects than to path. the port authority, dobrow said, has resisted extending tracks to newark international airport. the airport, which is run by the agency, is one of the fastest-growing in the country and offers limited public transportation. \\\"i think you could also argue that the port authority has done the minimum to make it work,\\\" he said. lloyd schwalb, a spokesman for the port authority, countered: \\\"we took a bankrupt heap that could barely run and made it into one of the best transit systems in the country. it's handling twice as many people as then, and over $1 billion has been invested in it by the port authority. that's putting your money where your mouth is. \\\"now we're putting another billion dollars into the system, and it's 90 percent our own funding. no other passenger railroad in the country can say that.\\\" the original $1.2-billion investment reflects $800 million in operating subsidies to cover the deficit and $400 million in deferred maintenance, officials said. the port authority is now investing $1 billion in the new and rehabilitated cars. it also is using the money to modernize and lengthen platforms at path's six oldest stations, mount a new entrance pavilion at exchange place in jersey city, and open a garage and yard in harrison.\",\"2\":\"the first reaction to the proposed $1 toll increase on the george washington bridge and the lincoln and holland tunnels was surprise, incredulity, and skepticism. the anger will come later. people asked, \\\"how could they be losing money?\\\" good question. the answer is that they aren't losing money. but path _ the port authority trans-hudson system _ is losing money, by the bucketful. drivers who have to wait in line to cross the hudson every day may snort, \\\"what do i care about path?\\\" well, they should care. as stephen berger, the executive director of the port authority, points out, trans-hudson transportation is a unified system. if you raise fares on path high enough to really cut its deficit, people will stop taking the trains and start driving to work, or trying to drive, and that will affect other motorists. it's a good point. still, when you look at the port authority's numbers, it is clear that revenues for the whole trans-hudson system, including the bridge, the tunnels, and the money-gobbling path line, are much higher than operating expenses. so you go back to the opening question: why does the authority need more money? the answer is to pay for capital improvements, $5.8 billion worth, nearly half of it to be spent at the region's three major airports. the capital program was launched in 1987, when berger took office, and it is a 5-year plan. it is ambitious. next year alone the authority is scheduled to invest $1.3 billion. by comparison, before berger took over at the agency, it was spending only $200 million a year for capital projects. the port authority's facilities are not in bad shape and will be better when the capital program is completed. as berger points out, the agency has had no fiascos like new york city's near-catastrophe with the williamsburg bridge. but couldn't the spending be phased out over a longer period than 5 years? berger says now is the time to invest, because contractors are hungry for work. bids are coming in lower than expected. again, a reasonable argument. but not dispositive. maybe the authority could defer some projects while doing others now. and then you start to look at particular projects and you begin to wonder. the authority is planning to lay out something like $300 million, for instance, on a \\\"people mover\\\" at newark airport. this would be a sort of monorail. it would take passengers from airport parking lots to the terminals and back. buses ply this route now, quite satisfactorily. why replace them? first, berger says, the airport is going to get a lot busier. ground access to the terminals has to be improved. all right, but is a $300 million monorail the best solution? would a modest buses-only lane work? is another, unacknowledged agenda at work here? the monorail would supplement and enhance the feasibility of a second, connecting monorail line, from newark to the airport and on to elizabeth. the second line has been proposed as a tool with which to encourage development in the two cities. and you wonder about the projections on which the authority is making its plans. in 1987 the airport handled 29 million passengers and the authority was predicting 45 million by the year 2000. today the airport is down to 21 million passengers a year. true, some of the decline is attributable to the demise of people express, a one-shot phenomenon. still, the year 2000 is only a decade away. is usage of newark airport going to double by then? the port authority, which used to have an image as the one governmental entity in the metropolitan region that really worked, has not been doing well lately. it put $25 million into a state-of-the-art fish processing and wholesaling plant in brooklyn, and not a single fishmonger or dealer left the fulton market for the new quarters. the plant was closed ignominously last spring. the authority pioneered a \\\"park and fly\\\" lot in ridgewood for travelers bound for newark airport. business didn't come close to the break-even point, even though the authority paid for the buses that a private operator used for the run to the airport. the buses didn't work, as it turned out. recently the authority has been embroiled in two embarrassing episodes. to hold down toll collectors' overtime it closed some toll lanes on the hudson river crossings _ in rush hours. and then it stopped selling commuter discount tickets at toll plazas and gas stations. commuters now have to mail in their orders, and some orders have gone astray. compounding the snafu, the authority is incomprehensibly giving toll collectors bonuses for not selling the tickets. the agency no longer seems infallible. the best course for governor kean and his successor, jim florio, is to defer approval of the toll increase until a fresh examination can be made of the authority and its plans. if we're going to pay more every time we cross the hudson, let's make sure we want the things the extra money will buy. james ahearn is the record's associate editor. sometimes the path to the station was crowded.\",\"3\":\"exchange place set to open june 29 jersey city - the exchange place commuter train station will open june 29 after being closed since the sept. 11 terrorist attacks

schedule, anthony cracchiolo, the port authority's director of capital programs, said during an agency meeting. the exchange place station, at montgomery street on the hudson river, was the last stop in new jersey before the path line entered new york and the world trade center area. the restoration was part of a $544 million project to rebuild the line into lower manhattan. the station, which

jostling has turned serious. the future of the newark bay container shipping ports, and of the larger port of new york, is suddenly open to question. so is the more basic matter of bistate cooperation in the common interests of the metropolitan region. in the 78 years since the port authority of new york and new jersey was created, that goal has been a given. it seems less certain now. the immediate issue is whether the port authority will renew the lease of two large container-shipping companies, maersk and sea-land. they employ 1,000 people, with a payroll of $100 million, at the elizabeth marine terminal. together they move a quarter of the containers that pass through the port of new york every year. maersk and sea-land want to stay where they are but don't want to pay as much rent as the port authority had proposed to charge them. the lines also seek deepening of the channels that lead to their piers, in order to accommodate a new generation of very large vessels. new wharves will be necessary too. the lines are not without alternatives to the new jersey terminals. the ports of baltimore and halifax are naturally deep enough for the new ships and eager to attract them, and baltimore, in particular, has offered to build a modern cargo-handling facility for maersk and sea-land, with wharves, cranes, and a rail connection. the new york-north jersey region is the biggest consumer market on the east coast. a port 150 miles distant would be at a disadvantage in serving it. you would assume that shippers would prefer to deliver directly to the heart of the region, rather than transfer containers from ships to trains, and then to tractor-trailers. still, baltimore keeps sweetening its offer, while the situation here has gotten more and more murky. the current problem is new york gov. george pataki. he is trying to use the maersk-sea-land negotiations to force a fundamental change in the allocation of port authority resources between new york and new jersey. basically, he wants more. that was not clear last year. the authority offered a new, 29-year lease to the two lines. the offer was formally presented by the authority's operations committee, headed by charles gargano, who is vice chairman of the authority board and pataki's economic development director. in effect, gargano was acting as pataki's agent in the negotiations. in september the lines rejected the offer. the authority went back to the drawing board and came up with a new proposal. but the governor of each state has the power to veto any authority action, and pataki put the kibosh on this one. last week governor whitman tried to finesse him. she said she would make up the difference between the old offer and the new one, using some of the $300 million in state dredging bonds that new jersey voters approved in 1996. nice try. pataki said no again, and it became clear that he was not so much opposed to the maersk-sea-land deal as to the basic division of port authority resources between the two states. he and the ever-combative new york city mayor, rudy giuliani, contend that new york is perennially shortchanged, that new jersey gets the better of the bistate deal. capital-spending statistics don't support that contention. in the last decade, the authority spent $2.8 billion on projects in new york and $1.7 billion in new jersey, with an additional $2.3 billion spent on interstate facilities. the authority's master plan calls for spending an additional $5 billion on new york projects, compared to $4.8 billion in new jersey. \\\"yes, but,\\\" say the new yorkers. yes, those numbers look good for new york, but consider what the authority lays out in operating subsidies every year for the port authority trans-hudson line and for the authority's manhattan bus terminal. the new yorkers say that the bus terminal, despite its location, is really a new jersey facility, and they have a point. most of the people who use it live on this side of the hudson and commute to jobs in the city. so too with the path line, which links newark, jersey city, and hoboken to lower and midtown manhattan. the line operates at a deficit, a big one. most mass-transit lines lose money, but there is a special reason this one is so unprofitable. its fare is only $1, unchanged since 1987. tom kean was governor of new jersey then. he was popular in his second term and ineligible for a third. he could and did permit the fare to rise, from 75 cents. his successors, first jim florio and now whitman, have balked at any further increase, fearing the political consequences. they have reason for concern. nevertheless, new york is no less politicized than new jersey, and the fare on the city's subways and buses is now $1.50, half again as high as the path fare. to cover the line's deficits, the authority uses profits from other facilities, such as the airports and the world trade center. new yorkers have a legitimate complaint here. a moderate path fare increase is overdue. pataki seems to have bigger changes in mind, though. he talks vaguely about a restructuring of the authority, with each state assuming responsibility for facilities on its side of the hudson. new york would direct operations at kennedy and laguardia airports and at the world trade center. new jersey would take over newark international airport and the container ports. it is not clear what would happen to the truly interstate facilities _ the george washington bridge, the lincoln and holland tunnels, and the three bridges between new jersey and staten island. it is hard to tell how serious pataki is about these notions. they would radically restructure the port authority. the region functions economically, culturally, and socially as a unified whole, and the authority has furthered the common interest. it would be a pity to lose that.\",\"5\":\"to the editor: \\\"why you can't trust the port authority\\\" (letter, oct. 21) by bill hine, on the port authority trans-hudson emergency ventilation facility on morton street, neglects the reason the facility was built: the safety of the thousands of commuters who travel between new york and new jersey daily. this method of commuting has long been the path of least resistance. yes, the facility could have been constructed with most of the fan equipment underground. however, the need for emergency exits, as well as the prohibitive expense and extended time to construct an underground facility, led to the conclusion that the course we took would best serve the public interest. as recently as today, the morton street ventilation equipment was invaluable in alleviating a smoke condition at the 14th street station. as for the impact of the facility on the planned hudson river park, path worked closely with the governor's and the mayor's west side panel to modify, at great expense, the design and improve the surrounding landscape. richard r. kelly v.p. & general manager, path new york, oct. 23, 1992\",\"6\":\"the path train has long served new york and northern new jersey, but its financial position has been heading down the wrong path for a long time. path came into existence in the 1960s, as part of a deal between the states of new york and new jersey and the port authority of new york and new jersey. the deal saw the creation of the word trade center on top of the path station in lower manhattan, which had several paths leading to it and was therefore valuable real-estate. since than path has cost more to run then it takes in via fares, sometimes by hundreds of millions of dollars. to get the system back on the path to financial stability, path will likely need financial support from local governments.\",\"7\":\"this summer i interned with path, a transit agency that serves northern new jersey. i am very happy i had this internship, it will help me on my career path in the field of public transit management. path is a small subway system, with only 13 stops (including six in manhattan and seven in new jersey, six of which are in hudson county). however, path punches above its weight, it has among the highest ridership in the country, nearly equal to that of bart \\u2013 the bay area rapid transit \\u2013 which has many more stations and miles of track and serves a much larger area. the reason path serves so many more people is that its service area is much more dense than many other american cities. the new york newark metropolitan area has lots of people living close together, and living close to path stations, with few obstacles in their path when they walk or bike to the stations. as a result, many more people can easily get to path than to other transit systems.\"},\"Entity

            "[{'text': 'in a dispute that could cause tensions between their republican governors, new york and new jersey are increasingly at odds over whether to raise the tolls on six bridges and tunnels that connect the two states, as well as the fare on the path commuter railway. officials in new jersey are lining up against a higher path fare and tolls, fearful of angering their constituents, who use these services more than new yorkers do. but many of their new york counterparts favor raising at least some of these fees, which, they maintain, are being kept artificially low. the issue is flaring now because of a budget deficit at the port authority of new york and new jersey, the bistate agency that runs the path and the six crossings: the george washington bridge, the lincoln and holland tunnels and the three bridges between staten island and new jersey. the port authority tolls have not risen since 1991, and the path, or port authority trans-hudson, fare has been $1 since 1987. and earlier this year, just before he left office, the authority\\'s executive director, stanley brezenoff, predicted that there would have to be increases if the agency were to solve its budget problems. many new york officials say they are acutely aware of how long the port authority tolls and path fare have stayed put, even as subway and bus fares and other tolls in new york city keep rising. \"it seems to me only fair that there should be some level of parity between these systems,\" said melvin l. schweitzer, a port authority board member from new york who is a strong supporter of raising the tolls and fare. another new york board member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also endorsed raising the tolls, though he was more hesitant about changing the path fare, saying it might reduce ridership. there are six board members from each state, and some have not announced their positions. but people who are familiar with the board\\'s deliberations say the new york side is leaning more toward increases than the new jersey side. many new jersey officials reject any link between the policies of the port authority and those of the metropolitan transportation authority, a new york state agency, which recently moved to raise subway and bus fares in new york city by 25 cents to $1.50, and round-trip tolls on its major bridges and tunnels by $1 to $7. by comparison, the toll at the bridges and tunnels run by the port authority is $4, paid by drivers entering new york. \"whatever we do is independent of any other agency, either in new york or new jersey,\" said the port authority chairwoman, kathleen a. donovan of new jersey. \"just because fares go up in new york, that doesn\\'t mean we want to raise fares.\" the debate over the increases, always politically wrenching, could drag on for months, pitting officials from the two states against each other and drawing in groups representing drivers, mass-transit advocates, environmentalists, industry and others. it could be settled quietly and without rancor, but if the past is any guide, that is unlikely. gov. george e. pataki of new york and gov. christine todd whitman of new jersey, either of whom could veto an increase approved by the authority\\'s board, have not announced where they stand yet. but interviews with their senior aides suggest that the governors\\' views may be diverging. the governors have already had one disagreement over the port authority. in january, mr. pataki angered mrs. whitman when he named george j. marlin to be mr. brezenoff\\'s successor without first consulting with her. many new york officials complain that even though the subway and bus fare is to be $1.50 under the m.t.a.\\'s recent proposal, the path fare is still $1 because path is far more subsidized than the subways. like some other new york officials, mr. schweitzer said the authority had to find a way to reduce the deficit on the path, which loses about $200 million a year. \"why is it that we have to continue to subsidize the path to such an extent?\" asked mr. schweitzer, who contends that the rail line drains money that the port authority could use for much-needed projects in both states. his arguments were echoed by deputy mayor john s. dyson of new york city. he said that he had consulted with many of the six new york members of the port authority\\'s board and that they were at the very least receptive to an increase in the path fare. \"our view is that the path train price ought to be the same as the city subways\\',\" mr. dyson said. \"the plain strategic fact of the matter is unless this disproportionate path subsidy is changed drastically there will never be money to do the things that we need done on this side of the river.\" and the senior pataki official who oversees the port authority, louis r. tomson, said the administration could not ignore the differences between the m.t.a.\\'s fees and the port authority\\'s. \"it is a large disparity and the question then is whether that disparity is justified,\" he said. \"if the subway fare goes to $1.50, it is going to cause everyone to look harder at the path fare.\" depending on how the calculations are done, fares currently cover 47 percent to 59 percent of the cost of the subway and bus system, and 25 percent to 38 percent of the cost of the path, officials said. the percentage figure for the new york city system will go up if the increase to $1.50 receives final approval. new jersey officials, in addition to leaders of environmental and transportation groups, point out that path, which runs from newark to jersey city to manhattan, benefits new york by giving commuters a cheap way of reaching jobs, particularly on wall street. it also provides an alternative to driving, reducing congestion and pollution. and they say raising the path fare by 25 cents, to $1.25, would be largely symbolic, generating only about $15 million a year, hardly a dent in the port authority\\'s $2.7 billion budget. a path increase coupled with a $1 increase on the tolls would yield an extra $140 million a year, officials said. ed lloyd, general counsel for the tri-state transportation campaign, a coalition of advocacy groups, said new york officials who favored a rise in the path fare were using skewed logic. the subsidy for path is in line with those for similar mass-transit systems around the nation, he said, while the subsidy for new york\\'s subway and bus system is the lowest subsidy for any major system in the country. \"there is a sort of false notion of parity,\" mr. lloyd said. \"new york is making a bad policy decision in increasing subway fares, and now they are looking for political cover by saying you should increase path as well.\" the last time the authority considered an increase, it became entangled in a battle that lasted two years. from 1989 to 1991, two new jersey governors, thomas h. kean and jim florio, repeatedly rejected an increase as politically unpalatable. finally, mr. florio relented halfway, allowing the tolls to rise to $4 from $3 but refusing to budge on the path fare. governor whitman, who has made her mark by cutting her state\\'s income taxes by 30 percent, has said she considers raising any kind of toll or fare akin to a tax increase. mrs. whitman, as well as mrs. donovan and some other port authority board members from new jersey, say they would give their approval only as a last resort after the authority first tried to close its budget gap by cutting spending. the authority is now seeking to do that by starting a hiring freeze and putting together plans that could end up trimming its staff of 9,000 workers by 5 percent to 10 percent, officials said. but unless the authority slices off significant parts of its budget, many of its costs, particularly those tied to labor, will keep growing even as revenues from tolls and fares are staying relatively flat. in other words, minor cuts may not solve a structural problem in the budget, so the issue of an increase may continue to dog the agency. at the same time, though, if governor whitman vetoes an increase this year, she is not likely to approve one next year because it is too close to 1997, when she has to run for re-election. the position of governor pataki, who is in his first year, is not known, and if his role in the the debate over the m.t.a. decision is any indication, he may choose to remain on the sidelines. it is a political rule of thumb that elected officials often agree to raising fees in their first year of office because by the time re-election rolls around, voters may have forgotten about it. chart: \"getting around: a closer look at the port authority\" shows revenues from port authority bridges, tunnels and path in 1994, fares for the new york city subway system and round-trip tolls for area crossing from 1970 to 1995.

'it has taken a quarter century of sporadic train delays and equipment failures, but the port authority trans-hudson rail system _ path _ is gaining the confidence of riders and critics. \"the system is beginning to improve, noticeably so,\" said douglas john bowen, vice-president of the new jersey association of railroad passengers, a west orange-based rider advocacy group, with more than 200 members. on the eve of the 25th anniversary of the port authority\\'s purchase of path _ the rail link that carries 210,000 commuters per day between northern new jersey and lower and midtown manhattan _ critics say the widespread deterioration that afflicted the system is a thing of the past. critics also say worsening traffic at hudson river bridge and tunnel crossings operated by the port authority of new york and new jersey has prompted a monetary commitment to improving path. the bistate agency is spending $200 million for 95 modern silvery cars with double doors and added seating. two thirds of the new cars have been placed in service, and an extra car is being added to every train, bringing 20 percent more capacity. in addition, the fleet of 248 path cars dating back to 1965 is being refurbished. the program, however, is a year behind schedule and will not be completed before next spring. about 80 of the rehabilitated cars are in service. figures show the port authority may be putting the skids on delays and breakdowns, but officials acknowledged it\\'s too early to tell for sure. in 1986, the incidents resulting in delays or temporary removal of trains rose to 1,431 _ 190 more than the number experienced in 1984. an \"incident\" can be anything from a broken door _ a common malady of overcrowded trains _ to problems with brakes, air-conditioning, and lighting. the latest figures show problems leveling off _ an average 121 incidents a month between january and july, compared with 120 during the same period in 1986. \"for a while there, we were in the worst position a rail operation could find itself, with a downward trend of available and reliable cars and a steady increase in ridership,\" said richard r. kelly, vice- president and general manager of the path corporation. \"but we\\'re getting back on track.\" path officials acknowledged that problems could have been avoided with a schedule of preventive maintenance, phased in, instead of a crash program requiring reliance on 38 vintage-1958 cars. but kelly said the work could not be done until a quick and reliable service shop was opened by the port authority two years ago. the shop, in jersey city, is a companion to an older, less efficient shop, also in jersey city. another factor was the contracting of private companies to overhaul trains, a procedure that began four years ago. \"i find path generally reliable,\" said hyman sprekman, an attorney for equitable life, as he waited on the hoboken platform one morning last week for the train to west 33rd street in manhattan. among a half-dozen passengers interviewed, none voiced major complaints about service, although a few said blackouts and loss of air-conditioning is still too common for comfort. path, a 14-mile, 1,130-employee operation, runs trains above ground, below ground, and under the hudson river _ in newark, harrison, jersey city, and hoboken. the manhattan stops are at the world trade center and between christopher street to 33rd street on the west side. the old hudson and manhattan railroad _ the hudson tubes _ was acquired by the port authority on sept. 1, 1962, after the bistate agency received contractual assurance that the debt-ridden operation would not hurt its credit rating or ability to finance other projects. path has experienced a twofold rise in patronage over the last days of the hudson tube. its passenger volume is comparable to that of the larger bay area rapid transit in san francisco. path officials expect 2,000 to 4,000 new riders a year through the mid-1990\\'s, a heavy burden for a system that has reached peak-period capacity. officials also are counting on new forms of transit, outside of path, to absorb the 80,000 more new jersey commuters to manhattan expected by the turn of the century. options include a planned port authority ferry service, at least three years from reality; a proposed trolley along the new jersey waterfront; and direct train service from the hackensack meadowlands to penn station in new york, which is envisioned by nj transit. for now, critics say path could do more to encourage people to use mass transit to manhattan, particularly during the off-peak times. on weekends, no direct service operates between hoboken and the world trade center, despite the proximity to south street seaport, battery park, and other downtown attractions. weekend travel to pavonia station in jersey city also remains difficult even though a new shopping mall has opened above ground. \"the lack of off-peak service is a disincentive,\" bowen said. \"with new commercial developments like the pavonia mall and newport {a massive commercial and residential project in jersey city}, path has a golden opportunity to attract weekend riders with more frequent trains.\" while rush-hour service is every three minutes, bowen said, off-peak service ranges from one train every 30 minutes _ a \"disaster\" _ to one every 15 minutes, \"which is only in the ballpark of acceptability for a major rail system.\" stephen b. dobrow, president of the committee for better transit, a commuter lobby concerned with new york and new jersey travel, said the port authority is more devoted to autos and lucrative economic development projects than to path. the port authority, dobrow said, has resisted extending tracks to newark international airport. the airport, which is run by the agency, is one of the fastest-growing in the country and offers limited public transportation. \"i think you could also argue that the port authority has done the minimum to make it work,\" he said. lloyd schwalb, a spokesman for the port authority, countered: \"we took a bankrupt heap that could barely run and made it into one of the best transit systems in the country. it\\'s handling twice as many people as then, and over $1 billion has been invested in it by the port authority. that\\'s putting your money where your mouth is. \"now we\\'re putting another billion dollars into the system, and it\\'s 90 percent our own funding. no other passenger railroad in the country can say that.\" the original $1.2-billion investment reflects $800 million in operating subsidies to cover the deficit and $400 million in deferred maintenance, officials said. the port authority is now investing $1 billion in the new and rehabilitated cars. it also is using the money to modernize and lengthen platforms at path\\'s six oldest stations, mount a new entrance pavilion at exchange place in jersey city, and open a garage and yard in harrison.', 'spans': [{'start': 130, 'end': 134, 'label': 'path'}, {'start': 474, 'end': 478, 'label': 'path'}, {'start': 872, 'end': 876, 'label': 'path'}, {'start': 1155, 'end': 1159, 'label':

the george washington bridge and the lincoln and holland tunnels was surprise, incredulity, and skepticism. the anger will come later. people asked, \"how could they be losing money?\" good question. the answer is that they aren\\'t losing money. but path _ the port authority trans-hudson system _ is losing money, by the bucketful. drivers who have to wait in line to cross the hudson every day may snort, \"what do i care about path?\" well, they should care. as stephen berger, the executive director of the port authority, points out, trans-hudson transportation is a unified system. if you raise fares on path high enough to really cut its deficit, people will stop taking the trains and start driving to work, or trying to drive, and that will affect other motorists. it\\'s a good point. still, when you look at the port authority\\'s numbers, it is clear that revenues for the whole trans-hudson system, including the bridge, the tunnels, and the money-gobbling path line, are much higher than operating expenses. so you go back to the opening question: why does the authority need more money? the answer is to pay for capital improvements, $5.8 billion worth, nearly half of it to be spent at the region\\'s three major airports. the capital program was launched in 1987, when berger took office, and it is a 5-year plan. it is ambitious. next year alone the authority is scheduled to invest $1.3 billion. by comparison, before berger took over at the agency, it was spending only $200 million a year for capital projects. the port authority\\'s facilities are not in bad shape and will be better when the capital program is completed. as berger points out, the agency has had no fiascos like new york city\\'s near-catastrophe with the williamsburg bridge. but couldn\\'t the spending be phased out over a longer period than 5 years? berger says now is the time to invest, because contractors are hungry for work. bids are coming in lower than expected. again, a reasonable argument. but not dispositive. maybe the authority could defer some projects while doing others now. and then you start to look at particular projects and you begin to wonder. the authority is planning to lay out something like $300 million, for instance, on a \"people mover\" at newark airport. this would be a sort of monorail. it would take passengers from airport parking lots to the terminals and back. buses ply this route now, quite satisfactorily. why replace them? first, berger says, the airport is going to get a lot busier. ground access to the terminals has to be improved. all right, but is a $300 million monorail the best solution? would a modest buses-only lane work? is another, unacknowledged agenda at work here? the monorail would supplement and enhance the feasibility of a second, connecting monorail line, from newark to the airport and on to elizabeth. the second line has been proposed as a tool with which to encourage development in the two cities. and you wonder about the projections on which the authority is making its plans. in 1987 the airport handled 29 million passengers and the authority was predicting 45 million by the year 2000. today the airport is down to 21 million passengers a year. true, some of the decline is attributable to the demise of people express, a one-shot phenomenon. still, the year 2000 is only a decade away. is usage of newark airport going to double by then? the port authority, which used to have an image as the one governmental entity in the metropolitan region that really worked, has not been doing well lately. it put $25 million into a state-of-the-art fish processing and wholesaling plant in brooklyn, and not a single fishmonger or dealer left the fulton market for the new quarters. the plant was closed ignominously last spring. the authority pioneered a \"park and fly\" lot in ridgewood for travelers bound for newark airport. business didn\\'t come close to the break-even point, even though the authority paid for the buses that a private operator used for the run to the airport. the buses didn\\'t work, as it turned out. recently the authority has been embroiled in two embarrassing episodes. to hold down toll collectors\\' overtime it closed some toll lanes on the hudson river crossings _ in rush hours. and then it stopped selling commuter discount tickets at toll plazas and gas stations. commuters now have to mail in their orders, and some orders have gone astray. compounding the snafu, the authority is incomprehensibly giving toll collectors bonuses for not selling the tickets. the agency no longer seems infallible. the best course for governor kean and his successor, jim florio, is to defer approval of the toll increase until a fresh examination can be made of the authority and its plans. if we\\'re going to pay more every time we cross the hudson, let\\'s make sure we want the things the extra money will buy. james ahearn is the record\\'s associate editor. sometimes the path

suddenly open to question. so is the more basic matter of bistate cooperation in the common interests of the metropolitan region. in the 78 years since the port authority of new york and new jersey was created, that goal has been a given. it seems less certain now. the immediate issue is whether the port authority will renew the lease of two large container-shipping companies, maersk and sea-land. they employ 1,000 people, with a payroll of $100 million, at the elizabeth marine terminal. together they move a quarter of the containers that pass through the port of new york every year. maersk and sea-land want to stay where they are but don\\'t want to pay as much rent as the port authority had proposed to charge them. the lines also seek deepening of the channels that lead to their piers, in order to accommodate a new generation of very large vessels. new wharves will be necessary too. the lines are not without alternatives to the new jersey terminals. the ports of baltimore and halifax are naturally deep enough for the new ships and eager to attract them, and baltimore, in particular, has offered to build a modern cargo-handling facility for maersk and sea-land, with wharves, cranes, and a rail connection. the new york-north jersey region is the biggest consumer market on the east coast. a port 150 miles distant would be at a disadvantage in serving it. you would assume that shippers would prefer to deliver directly to the heart of the region, rather than transfer containers from ships to trains, and then to tractor-trailers. still, baltimore keeps sweetening its offer, while the situation here has gotten more and more murky. the current problem is new york gov. george pataki. he is trying to use the maersk-sea-land negotiations to force a fundamental change in the allocation of port authority resources between new york and new jersey. basically, he wants more. that was not clear last year. the authority offered a new, 29-year lease to the two lines. the offer was formally presented by the authority\\'s operations committee, headed by charles gargano, who is vice chairman of the authority board and pataki\\'s economic development director. in effect, gargano was acting as pataki\\'s agent in the negotiations. in september the lines rejected the offer. the authority went back to the drawing board and came up with a new proposal. but the governor of each state has the power to veto any authority action, and pataki put the kibosh on this one. last week governor whitman tried to finesse him. she said she would make up the difference between the old offer and the new one, using some of the $300 million in state dredging bonds that new jersey voters approved in 1996. nice try. pataki said no again, and it became clear that he was not so much opposed to the maersk-sea-land deal as to the basic division of port authority resources between the two states. he and the ever-combative new york city mayor, rudy giuliani, contend that new york is perennially shortchanged, that new jersey gets the better of the bistate deal. capital-spending statistics don\\'t support that contention. in the last decade, the authority spent $2.8 billion on projects in new york and $1.7 billion in new jersey, with an additional $2.3 billion spent on interstate facilities. the authority\\'s master plan calls for spending an additional $5 billion on new york projects, compared to $4.8 billion in new jersey. \"yes, but,\" say the new yorkers. yes, those numbers look good for new york, but consider what the authority lays out in operating subsidies every year for the port authority trans-hudson line and for the authority\\'s manhattan bus terminal. the new yorkers say that the bus terminal, despite its location, is really a new jersey facility, and they have a point. most of the people who use it live on this side of the hudson and commute to jobs in the city. so too with the path line, which links newark, jersey city, and hoboken to lower and midtown manhattan. the line operates at a deficit, a big one. most mass-transit lines lose money, but there is a special reason this one is so unprofitable. its fare is only $1, unchanged since 1987. tom kean was governor of new jersey then. he was popular in his second term and ineligible for a third. he could and did permit the fare to rise, from 75 cents. his successors, first jim florio and now whitman, have balked at any further increase, fearing the political consequences. they have reason for concern. nevertheless, new york is no less politicized than new jersey, and the fare on the city\\'s subways and buses is now $1.50, half again as high as the path fare. to cover the line\\'s deficits, the authority uses profits from other facilities, such as the airports and the world trade center. new yorkers have a legitimate complaint here. a moderate path fare increase is overdue. pataki seems to have bigger changes in mind, though. he talks vaguely about a restructuring of the authority, with each state assuming responsibility for facilities on its side of the hudson. new york would direct operations at kennedy and laguardia airports and at the world trade center. new jersey would take over newark international airport and the container ports. it is not clear what would happen to the truly interstate facilities _ the george washington bridge, the lincoln and holland tunnels, and the three bridges between new jersey and staten island. it is hard to tell how serious pataki is about these notions. they would radically restructure the port authority. the region functions economically, culturally, and socially as a unified whole, and the authority has furthered the common interest. it would be a pity to lose that.', 'spans':

            "[{'text': 'in a dispute that could cause tensions between their republican governors, new york and new jersey are increasingly at odds over whether to raise the tolls on six bridges and tunnels that connect the two states, as well as the fare on the path commuter railway. officials in new jersey are lining up against a higher path fare and tolls, fearful of angering their constituents, who use these services more than new yorkers do. but many of their new york counterparts favor raising at least some of these fees, which, they maintain, are being kept artificially low. the issue is flaring now because of a budget deficit at the port authority of new york and new jersey, the bistate agency that runs the path and the six crossings: the george washington bridge, the lincoln and holland tunnels and the three bridges between staten island and new jersey. the port authority tolls have not risen since 1991, and the path, or port authority trans-hudson, fare has been $1 since 1987. and earlier this year, just before he left office, the authority\\'s executive director, stanley brezenoff, predicted that there would have to be increases if the agency were to solve its budget problems. many new york officials say they are acutely aware of how long the port authority tolls and path fare have stayed put, even as subway and bus fares and other tolls in new york city keep rising. \"it seems to me only fair that there should be some level of parity between these systems,\" said melvin l. schweitzer, a port authority board member from new york who is a strong supporter of raising the tolls and fare. another new york board member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also endorsed raising the tolls, though he was more hesitant about changing the path fare, saying it might reduce ridership. there are six board members from each state, and some have not announced their positions. but people who are familiar with the board\\'s deliberations say the new york side is leaning more toward increases than the new jersey side. many new jersey officials reject any link between the policies of the port authority and those of the metropolitan transportation authority, a new york state agency, which recently moved to raise subway and bus fares in new york city by 25 cents to $1.50, and round-trip tolls on its major bridges and tunnels by $1 to $7. by comparison, the toll at the bridges and tunnels run by the port authority is $4, paid by drivers entering new york. \"whatever we do is independent of any other agency, either in new york or new jersey,\" said the port authority chairwoman, kathleen a. donovan of new jersey. \"just because fares go up in new york, that doesn\\'t mean we want to raise fares.\" the debate over the increases, always politically wrenching, could drag on for months, pitting officials from the two states against each other and drawing in groups representing drivers, mass-transit advocates, environmentalists, industry and others. it could be settled quietly and without rancor, but if the past is any guide, that is unlikely. gov. george e. pataki of new york and gov. christine todd whitman of new jersey, either of whom could veto an increase approved by the authority\\'s board, have not announced where they stand yet. but interviews with their senior aides suggest that the governors\\' views may be diverging. the governors have already had one disagreement over the port authority. in january, mr. pataki angered mrs. whitman when he named george j. marlin to be mr. brezenoff\\'s successor without first consulting with her. many new york officials complain that even though the subway and bus fare is to be $1.50 under the m.t.a.\\'s recent proposal, the path fare is still $1 because path is far more subsidized than the subways. like some other new york officials, mr. schweitzer said the authority had to find a way to reduce the deficit on the path, which loses about $200 million a year. \"why is it that we have to continue to subsidize the path to such an extent?\" asked mr. schweitzer, who contends that the rail line drains money that the port authority could use for much-needed projects in both states. his arguments were echoed by deputy mayor john s. dyson of new york city. he said that he had consulted with many of the six new york members of the port authority\\'s board and that they were at the very least receptive to an increase in the path fare. \"our view is that the path train price ought to be the same as the city subways\\',\" mr. dyson said. \"the plain strategic fact of the matter is unless this disproportionate path subsidy is changed drastically there will never be money to do the things that we need done on this side of the river.\" and the senior pataki official who oversees the port authority, louis r. tomson, said the administration could not ignore the differences between the m.t.a.\\'s fees and the port authority\\'s. \"it is a large disparity and the question then is whether that disparity is justified,\" he said. \"if the subway fare goes to $1.50, it is going to cause everyone to look harder at the path fare.\" depending on how the calculations are done, fares currently cover 47 percent to 59 percent of the cost of the subway and bus system, and 25 percent to 38 percent of the cost of the path, officials said. the percentage figure for the new york city system will go up if the increase to $1.50 receives final approval. new jersey officials, in addition to leaders of environmental and transportation groups, point out that path, which runs from newark to jersey city to manhattan, benefits new york by giving commuters a cheap way of reaching jobs, particularly on wall street. it also provides an alternative to driving, reducing congestion and pollution. and they say raising the path fare by 25 cents, to $1.25, would be largely symbolic, generating only about $15 million a year, hardly a dent in the port authority\\'s $2.7 billion budget. a path increase coupled with a $1 increase on the tolls would yield an extra $140 million a year, officials said. ed lloyd, general counsel for the tri-state transportation campaign, a coalition of advocacy groups, said new york officials who favored a rise in the path fare were using skewed logic. the subsidy for path is in line with those for similar mass-transit systems around the nation, he said, while the subsidy for new york\\'s subway and bus system is the lowest subsidy for any major system in the country. \"there is a sort of false notion of parity,\" mr. lloyd said. \"new york is making a bad policy decision in increasing subway fares, and now they are looking for political cover by saying you should increase path as well.\" the last time the authority considered an increase, it became entangled in a battle that lasted two years. from 1989 to 1991, two new jersey governors, thomas h. kean and jim florio, repeatedly rejected an increase as politically unpalatable. finally, mr. florio relented halfway, allowing the tolls to rise to $4 from $3 but refusing to budge on the path fare. governor whitman, who has made her mark by cutting her state\\'s income taxes by 30 percent, has said she considers raising any kind of toll or fare akin to a tax increase. mrs. whitman, as well as mrs. donovan and some other port authority board members from new jersey, say they would give their approval only as a last resort after the authority first tried to close its budget gap by cutting spending. the authority is now seeking to do that by starting a hiring freeze and putting together plans that could end up trimming its staff of 9,000 workers by 5 percent to 10 percent, officials said. but unless the authority slices off significant parts of its budget, many of its costs, particularly those tied to labor, will keep growing even as revenues from tolls and fares are staying relatively flat. in other words, minor cuts may not solve a structural problem in the budget, so the issue of an increase may continue to dog the agency. at the same time, though, if governor whitman vetoes an increase this year, she is not likely to approve one next year because it is too close to 1997, when she has to run for re-election. the position of governor pataki, who is in his first year, is not known, and if his role in the the debate over the m.t.a. decision is any indication, he may choose to remain on the sidelines. it is a political rule of thumb that elected officials often agree to raising fees in their first year of office because by the time re-election rolls around, voters may have forgotten about it. chart: \"getting around: a closer look at the port authority\" shows revenues from port authority bridges, tunnels and path in 1994, fares for the new york city subway system and round-trip tolls for area crossing from 1970 to 1995.

'it has taken a quarter century of sporadic train delays and equipment failures, but the port authority trans-hudson rail system _ path _ is gaining the confidence of riders and critics. \"the system is beginning to improve, noticeably so,\" said douglas john bowen, vice-president of the new jersey association of railroad passengers, a west orange-based rider advocacy group, with more than 200 members. on the eve of the 25th anniversary of the port authority\\'s purchase of path _ the rail link that carries 210,000 commuters per day between northern new jersey and lower and midtown manhattan _ critics say the widespread deterioration that afflicted the system is a thing of the past. critics also say worsening traffic at hudson river bridge and tunnel crossings operated by the port authority of new york and new jersey has prompted a monetary commitment to improving path. the bistate agency is spending $200 million for 95 modern silvery cars with double doors and added seating. two thirds of the new cars have been placed in service, and an extra car is being added to every train, bringing 20 percent more capacity. in addition, the fleet of 248 path cars dating back to 1965 is being refurbished. the program, however, is a year behind schedule and will not be completed before next spring. about 80 of the rehabilitated cars are in service. figures show the port authority may be putting the skids on delays and breakdowns, but officials acknowledged it\\'s too early to tell for sure. in 1986, the incidents resulting in delays or temporary removal of trains rose to 1,431 _ 190 more than the number experienced in 1984. an \"incident\" can be anything from a broken door _ a common malady of overcrowded trains _ to problems with brakes, air-conditioning, and lighting. the latest figures show problems leveling off _ an average 121 incidents a month between january and july, compared with 120 during the same period in 1986. \"for a while there, we were in the worst position a rail operation could find itself, with a downward trend of available and reliable cars and a steady increase in ridership,\" said richard r. kelly, vice- president and general manager of the path corporation. \"but we\\'re getting back on track.\" path officials acknowledged that problems could have been avoided with a schedule of preventive maintenance, phased in, instead of a crash program requiring reliance on 38 vintage-1958 cars. but kelly said the work could not be done until a quick and reliable service shop was opened by the port authority two years ago. the shop, in jersey city, is a companion to an older, less efficient shop, also in jersey city. another factor was the contracting of private companies to overhaul trains, a procedure that began four years ago. \"i find path generally reliable,\" said hyman sprekman, an attorney for equitable life, as he waited on the hoboken platform one morning last week for the train to west 33rd street in manhattan. among a half-dozen passengers interviewed, none voiced major complaints about service, although a few said blackouts and loss of air-conditioning is still too common for comfort. path, a 14-mile, 1,130-employee operation, runs trains above ground, below ground, and under the hudson river _ in newark, harrison, jersey city, and hoboken. the manhattan stops are at the world trade center and between christopher street to 33rd street on the west side. the old hudson and manhattan railroad _ the hudson tubes _ was acquired by the port authority on sept. 1, 1962, after the bistate agency received contractual assurance that the debt-ridden operation would not hurt its credit rating or ability to finance other projects. path has experienced a twofold rise in patronage over the last days of the hudson tube. its passenger volume is comparable to that of the larger bay area rapid transit in san francisco. path officials expect 2,000 to 4,000 new riders a year through the mid-1990\\'s, a heavy burden for a system that has reached peak-period capacity. officials also are counting on new forms of transit, outside of path, to absorb the 80,000 more new jersey commuters to manhattan expected by the turn of the century. options include a planned port authority ferry service, at least three years from reality; a proposed trolley along the new jersey waterfront; and direct train service from the hackensack meadowlands to penn station in new york, which is envisioned by nj transit. for now, critics say path could do more to encourage people to use mass transit to manhattan, particularly during the off-peak times. on weekends, no direct service operates between hoboken and the world trade center, despite the proximity to south street seaport, battery park, and other downtown attractions. weekend travel to pavonia station in jersey city also remains difficult even though a new shopping mall has opened above ground. \"the lack of off-peak service is a disincentive,\" bowen said. \"with new commercial developments like the pavonia mall and newport {a massive commercial and residential project in jersey city}, path has a golden opportunity to attract weekend riders with more frequent trains.\" while rush-hour service is every three minutes, bowen said, off-peak service ranges from one train every 30 minutes _ a \"disaster\" _ to one every 15 minutes, \"which is only in the ballpark of acceptability for a major rail system.\" stephen b. dobrow, president of the committee for better transit, a commuter lobby concerned with new york and new jersey travel, said the port authority is more devoted to autos and lucrative economic development projects than to path. the port authority, dobrow said, has resisted extending tracks to newark international airport. the airport, which is run by the agency, is one of the fastest-growing in the country and offers limited public transportation. \"i think you could also argue that the port authority has done the minimum to make it work,\" he said. lloyd schwalb, a spokesman for the port authority, countered: \"we took a bankrupt heap that could barely run and made it into one of the best transit systems in the country. it\\'s handling twice as many people as then, and over $1 billion has been invested in it by the port authority. that\\'s putting your money where your mouth is. \"now we\\'re putting another billion dollars into the system, and it\\'s 90 percent our own funding. no other passenger railroad in the country can say that.\" the original $1.2-billion investment reflects $800 million in operating subsidies to cover the deficit and $400 million in deferred maintenance, officials said. the port authority is now investing $1 billion in the new and rehabilitated cars. it also is using the money to modernize and lengthen platforms at path\\'s six oldest stations, mount a new entrance pavilion at exchange place in jersey city, and open a garage and yard in harrison.', 'spans': [{'start': 130, 'end': 134, 'label': 'path'}, {'start': 474, 'end': 478, 'label': 'path'}, {'start': 872, 'end': 876, 'label': 'path'}, {'start': 1155, 'end': 1159, 'label':

the george washington bridge and the lincoln and holland tunnels was surprise, incredulity, and skepticism. the anger will come later. people asked, \"how could they be losing money?\" good question. the answer is that they aren\\'t losing money. but path _ the port authority trans-hudson system _ is losing money, by the bucketful. drivers who have to wait in line to cross the hudson every day may snort, \"what do i care about path?\" well, they should care. as stephen berger, the executive director of the port authority, points out, trans-hudson transportation is a unified system. if you raise fares on path high enough to really cut its deficit, people will stop taking the trains and start driving to work, or trying to drive, and that will affect other motorists. it\\'s a good point. still, when you look at the port authority\\'s numbers, it is clear that revenues for the whole trans-hudson system, including the bridge, the tunnels, and the money-gobbling path line, are much higher than operating expenses. so you go back to the opening question: why does the authority need more money? the answer is to pay for capital improvements, $5.8 billion worth, nearly half of it to be spent at the region\\'s three major airports. the capital program was launched in 1987, when berger took office, and it is a 5-year plan. it is ambitious. next year alone the authority is scheduled to invest $1.3 billion. by comparison, before berger took over at the agency, it was spending only $200 million a year for capital projects. the port authority\\'s facilities are not in bad shape and will be better when the capital program is completed. as berger points out, the agency has had no fiascos like new york city\\'s near-catastrophe with the williamsburg bridge. but couldn\\'t the spending be phased out over a longer period than 5 years? berger says now is the time to invest, because contractors are hungry for work. bids are coming in lower than expected. again, a reasonable argument. but not dispositive. maybe the authority could defer some projects while doing others now. and then you start to look at particular projects and you begin to wonder. the authority is planning to lay out something like $300 million, for instance, on a \"people mover\" at newark airport. this would be a sort of monorail. it would take passengers from airport parking lots to the terminals and back. buses ply this route now, quite satisfactorily. why replace them? first, berger says, the airport is going to get a lot busier. ground access to the terminals has to be improved. all right, but is a $300 million monorail the best solution? would a modest buses-only lane work? is another, unacknowledged agenda at work here? the monorail would supplement and enhance the feasibility of a second, connecting monorail line, from newark to the airport and on to elizabeth. the second line has been proposed as a tool with which to encourage development in the two cities. and you wonder about the projections on which the authority is making its plans. in 1987 the airport handled 29 million passengers and the authority was predicting 45 million by the year 2000. today the airport is down to 21 million passengers a year. true, some of the decline is attributable to the demise of people express, a one-shot phenomenon. still, the year 2000 is only a decade away. is usage of newark airport going to double by then? the port authority, which used to have an image as the one governmental entity in the metropolitan region that really worked, has not been doing well lately. it put $25 million into a state-of-the-art fish processing and wholesaling plant in brooklyn, and not a single fishmonger or dealer left the fulton market for the new quarters. the plant was closed ignominously last spring. the authority pioneered a \"park and fly\" lot in ridgewood for travelers bound for newark airport. business didn\\'t come close to the break-even point, even though the authority paid for the buses that a private operator used for the run to the airport. the buses didn\\'t work, as it turned out. recently the authority has been embroiled in two embarrassing episodes. to hold down toll collectors\\' overtime it closed some toll lanes on the hudson river crossings _ in rush hours. and then it stopped selling commuter discount tickets at toll plazas and gas stations. commuters now have to mail in their orders, and some orders have gone astray. compounding the snafu, the authority is incomprehensibly giving toll collectors bonuses for not selling the tickets. the agency no longer seems infallible. the best course for governor kean and his successor, jim florio, is to defer approval of the toll increase until a fresh examination can be made of the authority and its plans. if we\\'re going to pay more every time we cross the hudson, let\\'s make sure we want the things the extra money will buy. james ahearn is the record\\'s associate editor. sometimes the path

suddenly open to question. so is the more basic matter of bistate cooperation in the common interests of the metropolitan region. in the 78 years since the port authority of new york and new jersey was created, that goal has been a given. it seems less certain now. the immediate issue is whether the port authority will renew the lease of two large container-shipping companies, maersk and sea-land. they employ 1,000 people, with a payroll of $100 million, at the elizabeth marine terminal. together they move a quarter of the containers that pass through the port of new york every year. maersk and sea-land want to stay where they are but don\\'t want to pay as much rent as the port authority had proposed to charge them. the lines also seek deepening of the channels that lead to their piers, in order to accommodate a new generation of very large vessels. new wharves will be necessary too. the lines are not without alternatives to the new jersey terminals. the ports of baltimore and halifax are naturally deep enough for the new ships and eager to attract them, and baltimore, in particular, has offered to build a modern cargo-handling facility for maersk and sea-land, with wharves, cranes, and a rail connection. the new york-north jersey region is the biggest consumer market on the east coast. a port 150 miles distant would be at a disadvantage in serving it. you would assume that shippers would prefer to deliver directly to the heart of the region, rather than transfer containers from ships to trains, and then to tractor-trailers. still, baltimore keeps sweetening its offer, while the situation here has gotten more and more murky. the current problem is new york gov. george pataki. he is trying to use the maersk-sea-land negotiations to force a fundamental change in the allocation of port authority resources between new york and new jersey. basically, he wants more. that was not clear last year. the authority offered a new, 29-year lease to the two lines. the offer was formally presented by the authority\\'s operations committee, headed by charles gargano, who is vice chairman of the authority board and pataki\\'s economic development director. in effect, gargano was acting as pataki\\'s agent in the negotiations. in september the lines rejected the offer. the authority went back to the drawing board and came up with a new proposal. but the governor of each state has the power to veto any authority action, and pataki put the kibosh on this one. last week governor whitman tried to finesse him. she said she would make up the difference between the old offer and the new one, using some of the $300 million in state dredging bonds that new jersey voters approved in 1996. nice try. pataki said no again, and it became clear that he was not so much opposed to the maersk-sea-land deal as to the basic division of port authority resources between the two states. he and the ever-combative new york city mayor, rudy giuliani, contend that new york is perennially shortchanged, that new jersey gets the better of the bistate deal. capital-spending statistics don\\'t support that contention. in the last decade, the authority spent $2.8 billion on projects in new york and $1.7 billion in new jersey, with an additional $2.3 billion spent on interstate facilities. the authority\\'s master plan calls for spending an additional $5 billion on new york projects, compared to $4.8 billion in new jersey. \"yes, but,\" say the new yorkers. yes, those numbers look good for new york, but consider what the authority lays out in operating subsidies every year for the port authority trans-hudson line and for the authority\\'s manhattan bus terminal. the new yorkers say that the bus terminal, despite its location, is really a new jersey facility, and they have a point. most of the people who use it live on this side of the hudson and commute to jobs in the city. so too with the path line, which links newark, jersey city, and hoboken to lower and midtown manhattan. the line operates at a deficit, a big one. most mass-transit lines lose money, but there is a special reason this one is so unprofitable. its fare is only $1, unchanged since 1987. tom kean was governor of new jersey then. he was popular in his second term and ineligible for a third. he could and did permit the fare to rise, from 75 cents. his successors, first jim florio and now whitman, have balked at any further increase, fearing the political consequences. they have reason for concern. nevertheless, new york is no less politicized than new jersey, and the fare on the city\\'s subways and buses is now $1.50, half again as high as the path fare. to cover the line\\'s deficits, the authority uses profits from other facilities, such as the airports and the world trade center. new yorkers have a legitimate complaint here. a moderate path fare increase is overdue. pataki seems to have bigger changes in mind, though. he talks vaguely about a restructuring of the authority, with each state assuming responsibility for facilities on its side of the hudson. new york would direct operations at kennedy and laguardia airports and at the world trade center. new jersey would take over newark international airport and the container ports. it is not clear what would happen to the truly interstate facilities _ the george washington bridge, the lincoln and holland tunnels, and the three bridges between new jersey and staten island. it is hard to tell how serious pataki is about these notions. they would radically restructure the port authority. the region functions economically, culturally, and socially as a unified whole, and the authority has furthered the common interest. it would be a pity to lose that.', 'spans':

the fan equipment underground. however, the need for emergency exits, as well as the prohibitive expense and extended time to construct an underground facility, led to the conclusion that the course we took would best serve the public interest. as recently as today, the morton street ventilation equipment was invaluable in alleviating a smoke condition at the 14th street station. as for the

''banks was with overwatch for less than two years and was long gone before the contracts you reference were ever awarded,'' mr. brafman said. on friday, a spokeswoman for the mayor's office, liz garcia, said that mr. banks had divested from the company before joining the administration, but she did not say when he did so or provide documents reflecting the divestment. she said he had had no involvement in its operation in years. a lawyer for sheena wright, xavier r. donaldson, declined to comment. the security company was founded in 2010 by dwayne montgomery, a retired police inspector who worked and socialized with mr. adams at the police department. mr. montgomery was charged last year with conspiring to funnel illegal donations to mr. adams's 2021 mayoral campaign; mr. montgomery pleaded guilty to misdemeanor conspiracy in february and was sentenced to 200 hours of community service. mr. banks bought the security firm with a partner, a former police sergeant named soyini chan-shue, from mr. montgomery months after mr. banks abruptly retired from the police department amid a federal corruption probe. mr. banks, who had been the chief of department, the highest-ranking uniformed official on the force, was labeled an unindicted co-conspirator in that wide-ranging corruption investigation, which resulted in several convictions, including that of a police department chief who served as his top aide, as well as mr. banks's close friend, the head of the correction officers' union. mr. banks was never charged with any crime. after mr. banks joined the security firm, it began using the name city safe partners, records show. on its website, the company prominently featured mr. banks's credentials with the police department. ''philip banks iii is one of the highest-profile security and law enforcement leaders in america,'' the website said. ''his extensive executive-level security and law enforcement experience spans 28 years culminating in his role as the highest-ranking uniformed position in the new york city police department.'' winnie greco, who would become mr. adams's special adviser and director of asian affairs, was also prominently displayed on the company's website as a member of the management team in 2018, according to an archived version of the site. ms. greco, a major fund-raiser for mr. adams during his mayoral campaign, has close ties to new york city's chinese community. her homes were searched by agents in february as part of a separate federal investigation. ms. greco was engaged by city safe to generate new business by providing ''training of chinese security staff,'' but no business ever materialized and she was paid no money by the firm, the company representative said. a lawyer for ms. greco, steven brill, said his client had no substantive role with the company. ''winnie has no connection to this company,'' he said. city safe is currently helmed by ms. chan-shue, the former sergeant with the police department, who long worked under mr. banks during his time there. after more than two decades at the department, ms. chan-shue retired and then became the chief executive of city safe in 2016, according to her linkedin profile. since it was launched, the security firm has advertised its status as a minority-owned business -- a designation that allowed it to qualify for certain government business under programs aimed at giving contracts to firms owned by women and members of minority groups, records show. before mr. adams took office, city safe did some business with the city, records show. it was paid $4,773 by the department of parks &amp; recreation in 2014 to provide security guards for a summer solstice event at an office building in harlem, according to a department spokeswoman. it also had some business with the state. in 2017, the company started receiving a portion of a contract with the metropolitan transportation authority, a state-run agency, to provide security guards to patrol subway stations as part of a push to improve safety. another aim of the contract was to combat fare evasion -- which would become a priority for mr. adams once he took office and installed mr. banks as an influential public safety aide. the company continued as a subcontractor until april 2024, according to the authority. they were paid $7.2 million, the city safe representative said. after mr. adams took office, the company's business with the city and other government entities appeared to take off, records show. in 2022, city safe partners was hired as a subcontractor to help provide vetting and identification cards to staff members at kennedy and newark liberty airports, the company representative said. the subcontract was worth $10 million, according to records the firm provided to the city. both airports are managed not by city officials but by the state-run port authority of new york and new jersey. the work was performed on behalf of the new jersey-based company inter-con security. in january of that year, inter-con announced that it had been selected as the sole awardee of the port authority's five-year contract for uniformed security guard services. the company's news release said it would be responsible for providing more than 1,000 security guards for the kennedy, la guardia and newark airports, the world trade center campus and the port authority trans-hudson transit system. inter-con's vice president, matthew reeser, confirmed to the times that city safe had performed subcontracting work under that contract but declined to provide details about the amount and nature of the agreement. in 2023, the new york city housing authority was unhappy with the performance of a security company that it had hired to provide fire safety services, and the agency began looking for new firms, prioritizing those classified as minority and women-owned businesses, an agency spokeswoman said. the authority launched a competitive bidding process, and four companies submitted quotes, the spokeswoman said. city safe was one of them. as part of the contract, city safe would place up to 500 guards in more than 150 public housing developments to monitor them for fires. at a board meeting in january, housing authority officials said that state law had required them to have people watching out for fires around the clock while repairs were being made to fire safety systems. jamie rubin, the chair of the authority's board, questioned the need to spend $154 million and said he felt like there ''had to be another \n",

[ page 23. ] james fox, an assistant director of the federal bureau of investigation in charge of the agency's new york office, said that no bomb fragments were found but that a joint terrorist task force of federal agents and city detectives had examined the wreckage and believed that a car bomb had caused the explosion. there was no warning of an impending explosion, police commissioner raymond w. kelly said. jack killorin, a spokesman in washington for the treasury department's bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms, said that after the blast, authorities received at least nine telephone calls claiming responsibility. mr. killorin said the first call was made 15 minutes after the blast to a non-emergency number of a new york police department precinct by an individual who mentioned the conflict in bosnia. he said other claims were made between an hour and several hours after the event by callers who cited that and a variety of other reasons for the attack. he declined to elaborate. some law-enforcement officials said an explosion of such size, without a claim of responsibility in advance, might suggest that it went off accidentally. mr. kelly was more oblique about the cause of the blast, saying only that a car bomb or other type of explosive device was not being ruled out. four hours after the explosion, a bomb threat forced the evacuation of the empire state building in midtown manhattan, and there were numerous other bomb threats in the city, the police said. but it was unclear if any were related to the world trade center explosion or only the macabre work of pranksters. as the day ended, a series of investigations began -- into the cause of the explosion and its possible perpetrators, and into what went wrong in what many called a botched evacuation, with no alarms and no instructions for thousands caught in dark, smoky stairwells, in stark contrast to carefully laid plans. mayor david n. dinkins, visiting in osaka, japan, was notified by city hall and, in a telephone news conference, called the fire department response the largest for any non-natural disaster in the city's history. he said he had spoken with president clinton and had thanked him for the cooperation of federal investigators. the effects of the blast radiated outward, disrupting most non-cable television transmissions throughout the metropolitan area, halting traffic in most of lower manhattan and \n",

'everything was on fire' it also collapsed the ceiling of a mezzanine in the adjacent port authority trans-hudson train station, leaving dozens trapped under rubble on a concourse one floor above the platforms where hundreds awaited trains. witnesses and rescue workers told of a blast of incredible force -- of bodies hurtling through the air, of cars wrapped around pillars, of people burning and scores trapped. &quot;we crawled under pipes when we arrived and everything was on fire,&quot; said edward bergen, a 38-year-old firefighter who was one of the first to reach the scene of the blast. &quot;suddenly, a guy came walking out of the flames, like one of those zombies in the movie, 'the night of the living dead.' his flesh was hanging off. he was a middle-aged man.&quot; fire capt. timothy dowling, of engine company 6, recalled a ghastly scene of fires lapping in the darkness, illuminating a smoking hell of twisted cars and broken concrete. &quot;it looked like a bomb had exploded because of the amount of fire and damage to the floors. all we could do was put water on the flames.&quot; 'the dust was blinding' ken olson, 34, a pipefitter, was in the basement when the explosion hit. &quot;all of a sudden all hell broke loose,&quot; he said. &quot;all the pipes ruptured, the dust was blinding. luckily we all stayed together and got out.&quot; nearby, vito de leo, 32, an air-conditioning mechanic, was eating lunch at his desk with other basement trade center workers. suddenly, the desk rose up, came down and landed on top of him. but its well protected him from a rain of falling debris. &quot;the furniture collapsed, the walls collapsed, the ceiling collapsed,&quot; he said. &quot;there was total blackness. i thought i was dead.&quot; later, wading through knee-deep water amid gas pipelines danging overhead in the garage, a cadre of firefighters, police officers and other rescue workers found two bodies in a lunchroom used by mechanics, another body in the mangled wreckage of a car, and more victims under the debris in the garage. the five victims -- three men, one woman and one unidentified -- were all believed to heve been killed by the blast. they were not immediately identified but the port authority said that they were all believed to be authority workers or people working under contract to the agency. the authorities said that more bodies might be found in the rubble as the search went on. the police said 420 workers and visitors at the trade center were treated at hospitals, along with 44 firefighters, 11 police officers and one emergency medical service worker. meantime, as several fires erupted around the scene of the explosion, heavy smoke billowed up through the corridors, elevator shafts and stairwells of the trade center. because of the time, shortly after noon, many workers were at lunch at nearby restaurants or at fast-food outlets on the ground floor, from where they easily escaped. but the police estimated that as many as 50,000 people -- workers, tourists and other visitors were still in the building, many of them trapped on the highest floors -- and it was not merely the blast that shook the entire complex, not merely the growing volumes of smoke pouring upward, that frightened them. darkness and the unknown perils that awaited them below added to the fears. much of the power to the trade center had been knocked out by the blast -- consolidated edison said four of its eight feeder cables to the center were shut down. and within an hour, at the request of the fire department, which was trying to protect rescue workers and firefighters in dangerous areas, all power to the trade center was shut off by con edison, as well as natural gas and steam to the complex, which houses thousands of offices in six buildings bounded by church, west, liberty and vesey streets. pat richardi, a con edison spokeswoman, said that no hazardous materials, such as polychlorinated biphenals, were in any of the transformers or cables of the trade center, which was completed 22 years ago. many of the people climbing down stairs told of having to stop frequently because of panic below; some let pregnant women and old people go through; some nearly passed out with exhaustion; others told of tense minutes in which they sat down on the steps, trying to regain \n",

Further training data should include instances of the common word path, so that the model will not give false positives (incorectly identifying the common word as an ORG). Once the model is properly trained, it should be combined with an existing spaCy model capable of recognizing other entities (possible the en_core_web_sm model used at the begining of this project). Once such a combined model exists, researchers can perform all necessary data cleaning on textual data containing \"PATH\". Doing so would allow researchers to better identify public sentiment toward PATH, related topics mentioned along-side PATH, and leaders or communities that hold strong opinions of the transit system."
